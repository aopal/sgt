## Introduction

Welcome! This page is the repository of all knowledge that you, the player, have access to about the world of the Shattered God's Tomb. Things are organized into sections below, but first I need to mention one overarching thing.

I'm running SGT a little different from traditional campaigns. I personally believe that giving players as much choice and freedom as possible is what makes for the best stories, so SGT will be run in a pseudo-open world manner. The setting is limited to just the tomb, not the full map below, but there is no set story I have in mind. 

This is a style I've experienced as a player before, and have found it works well and is a lot of fun. The friend that introduced me to this style ran it and several other open-world style TTRPGs to great success (one campaign's session 0 involved him showing us a 1.1 million square kilometer continent map, then saying "Pick a place you want to start, anywhere at all, and I'll write something for next week." I'm not doing that), so I'm confident it won't implode in my face.

In session one you will be dropped into the setting, but after that you have free reign. There are a variety of factions and characters for you to interact with, who you want to help and who you want to make into an enemy will be decided entirely by your actions. If you want to betray a faction for another part way through, or else eschew them all and do you own thing, all of that is allowed.

Relatedly, if there's something not in the PHB that you really want to play, feel free to ask and I may approve it. By default I'm mostly only allowing base PHB stuff since it's my first time DMing, but if it fits the world and the rules are straightforward enough there's a decent chance I'll say yes.

## The World

![](./world.png)

(There are no icons/borders/labels on the map because I'm still fleshing out the larger world)

Note that you will not have this entire map to explore, only a small section (12-15 hexes) around the Shattered God's Tomb. This is just here as it's the only map I have so far. For scale, each hex is 15 miles/24 kilometers across. The world is smaller than Earth, roughly the size of Earth's moon. This puts northern edge of the above map at 20 degrees south, and the southern edge at 70 degrees south. Using Earth as an analogue, the northern edge of the map has the equivalent latitude (though opposite hemisphere) and climate of Mali or India, and the southern edge is equivalent to the northern coast of Alaska or Norway.

The Shattered God's Tomb is located on the continent of Athol (ATH-all) in the east. The continent Evras (ev-RASS) is on the west. The continents have been populated for much longer than recorded history, having seen the rise and fall of numerous civilizations, many of whom unfortunately took their knowledge with them. 

Change, some might call it chaos, is the defining trait of Atholian and Evrasian history. Nearly every city is built on the ruins of a far older one, if not many older ones. Few large empires or kingdoms endure more than a scant handful of centuries. Whether by internal stress, war with another nation, or the meddling of a god, mortal attempts at greatness don't seem to last long. The present state of the two continents reflects this; there are only a couple of large kingdoms, and young ones at that. Smaller duchies and city states abound instead.

The cycle of change holds not only for the nations of the two continents, but to the pantheon as well. The gods of Evras and Athol are numerous and powerful, and eternally locked in cold war with each other. Many heroes and kings have been, knowingly or not, nothing more than pawns in the games of gods, and their gambits for power. When those gambits fail, however, a god might find themself struck down by their opponent, whether by direct war in heaven, or by some plucky farmer with a battered sword. Some gods burn so bright and fast that there are individual mortals that lived through both their birth and death.

## A Note on Culture and Language

The world is old, and few scholars claim to know how the different species came to be on Athol and Evras, and even then no two theories agree. The continents have been shaped and re-shaped many times over by the will of empires and gods, to the point that even if the different species were ever their own nations with their own languages, as some myths claim, any evidence of that has been lost to the ages. Culture and language has come to be defined by boundaries of geography and civilization, not lines of species. Members of every species can be found on every corner and in nearly every nation on either continent. That's not to say there is never tension between members of different species, far from it, but rare has been the occurrence of a mono-species nation in all of recorded history. 

A full list of languages can be found in [appendix E](#appendix-e--languages), though it has some notable entries worth talking about. Common is the prevailing language on the two continents and known by nearly anyone who travels beyond their own nation's borders. It evolved as a trader tongue by nations on the dancing sea before later spreading further east and west, and is mostly comprised of a mix of ancient Mikhesal and Salasan, with a sprinkling of Vrokish. Other more exotic languages have come to be known, though only by a select few. These are largely the languages of powerful magical or other-worldly beings, such as dragons or the celestial messengers of the gods.

## The Shattered God's Tomb

(Map forthcoming)

### History

Many centuries ago almost all of northern and eastern Athol was controlled by the Mikhesal (MIK-eh-sahl) empire. An extremely expansionistic empire, it quickly rose from a small dukedom to a continent-spanning empire. Mikhesal's success was in part due to the extreme number of storied heroes they managed to enlist, or else emerged during the empires campaigns. Their secret however, was their patronage from the then god of war, Immog. An ancient red dragon so powerful it achieved godhood, Immog's blessing of magical power and weapons made Mikhesal unstoppable.

Shortly after reaching its fifth century of existence, internal conflict split the empire into two factions nearly equal in power. A long and bloody civil war culminated in a last stand between the two factions, where both sides brought all the heroes and weapons they could muster. The loyalists, still patronized by Immog, seemed poised to win. In an act of desperation, the rebels' mages banded together to do the one thing they thought would give them a chance at victory and survival, as Mikhesal and Immog were not known for mercy: pull Immog from his plane to the mortal realm and destroy him utterly with a single ritual.

Their plan worked, in a sense. Immog fell screaming to the mortal battlefield, being torn asunder as he fell by the magic of an entire civilization working together. The release of Immog's power, along with the ritual spell itself going out of control, destroyed not just the god but also both armies and hundreds of square miles of land. There were no survivors of the battle, but the shattering of the god and the battlefield was seen or felt on much of the continent. The sheer power of the event broke the bedrock and sent an earthquake travelling through much of the northern bit of the continent.

#### Aftermath of the Shattering

The Shattered God's Tomb, as the battlefield where Immog and Mikhesal were destroyed utterly came to be known, was almost completely avoided for centuries after its overnight creation. The canyons that formed in an instant were deep enough to crack open magma chambers in some places. That, combined with Immog's element of fire being released, made the area far too hot for any person to survive for several centuries, and avoided for even longer after that. 

It is only in the last 80 years or so that explorers and adventurers have visited the canyon network. Those who survived exploring their depths and managed to climb back out brought back treasure and weapons of the legendary heroes that were at the battle, but also stories of the powerful monsters birthed by the spilled blood of a god. One story particularly caught peoples' imaginations like wildfire: that Immog himself was not dead, merely broken and dormant. In recent years a town has popped up on the western edge of the Tomb, drawing in adventurers from the world over seeking to find riches and power.

The continent of Athol, after the regime that controlled much of it vanished overnight, went through several centuries of turmoil as the few nobles and cities that didn't send their warriors to the Tomb scrambled for power in the vaccuum. In the present day many duchies and city states can be found, most either unable or uninterested in expanding their borders.

### Description

A maze of extremely deep sheer canyons covering a few hundred square miles, formed by the immense power released at Immog's shattering also breaking the bedrock (for those who read Sanderson, yes it's partially inspired by the shattered plains). The lower walls and bed of the canyons are primarily a mix of basalt, slate, obsidian and marble, igneous and metamorphic rocks formed by the sheer heat and pressure the Shatterring wrought. The walls, at least near the top, are covered by an almost glass-like substance that has come to be known as Vidrite, which some say is the dried blood of the god. Vidrite reflects some light down into the deeps of the canyons below, granting it some some light during most of the day.

Canyons range from 700-1500 metres deep, usually 50-100 metres wide and almost always sheer. The spilled blood and power of a war god and two armies has left the place permeated by powerful magic. Many strange plants grow unnaturally quickly on the base of the canyons allowing for a lot of food without much sunlight. The base of the canyons are colloquially referred to as the Catacombs.

The Town of Hope's Rock was founded on the western edge of the Tomb. Serviced by the Grand Lift, a marvel of engineering made by engineers from the city of Caesal, most of the town is built into the rock at the base of the canyons. Though many people find life in Hope's Rock and the Catacombs to be eerie and claustrophobic, many others find the place immensely beautiful. Between the unique plant and animal life, the vidrite walls of the canyons and the ethereal light from the vidrite suffusing the Catacombs, many artists and poets flock to the place for inspiration.

### Factions

(To be expanded) 


<!-- #### The Cult of the Shattered god

Founded by explorers in the Catacombs. They worship the fallen god of war, Immog, who they believe is not fully dead yet. Do not take kindly to open worship of other gods, and are particularly not fond of the Priests of Ebor. -->

#### The Merchants of Adventure
The organization made up of Caesalan merchants and engineers that built both the town of Hope's Rock and the Grand Lift. Widely viewed as greedy bureaucrats, they are famously crafty, but will stick to their word.

<!-- #### The Priests of Ebor
Group of priests of the god of peace. Led by Bishop Ormen, they seek to find any truth to the rumors that Immog yet lives. They do not take kindly to the shattered cult. -->

<!-- #### The Lirian Embassy
Agents of the Free City of Liria, searching the Catacombs for any and all enchanted objects, especially those extremely powerful artifacts they can learn new magic from. Some claim they are especially interested in the magical weapons, hoping to build up an arsenal to increase Liria's domain. -->

<!-- #### The Wild Embassy
Not actually an official delegation, but a collection of inhabitants from the Wild Kingdom that seek to find rare creatures in the Tomb. Many people say that never before seen monsters are in the Tomb, the inhabitants of the wild hope to find members of species once thought extinct. -->

### Characters

(forthcoming) 

### Locations & Landmarks

#### Hope's Rock
(Map forthcoming)

The town surrounding the Grand Lift, population 200-300 (it tends to change monthly, if not weekly). Separated into the Upper Rock at the top of the lift, and the Lower Rock at its base. Named after the huge vidrite boulder, of the same material of the walls of the cliffs, next to which resides the lift. The Upper Rock is far smaller, mostly only for unloading supplies to be sent to the Lower Rock. The lower rock is far larger and centered around the meeting of 3 canyons, resulting in the three major (and only) streets of the lower town. 

#### The Lower Rock
The town at the base of the Grand Lift. Comprised of a central square and three major streets walled off from the rest of the canyon network, defined by the natural floor of the canyon. Each street is named after the monster that most plagued the early denizens of the Lower Rock when trying to wall off that passageway. The street that heads north of the square is named Beholder's boulevard, the street veering southeast is Demon's lane, and the southbound street is Dragon's gulch.

#### The Hope
The outcrop of vidrite nearly 50 feet tall around which the town of Hope's Rock was built and named. Some claim it's shaped like a fang, though many dismiss this, saying the resemblance is rough at best. The only known piece of vidrite not attached to the walls of the canyons, at its peak appears to be a blue banner, encased in vidrite but still mostly visible through the crystal. Whatever symbol might have been present on the banner cannot be seen. Its unknown what material the banner is made of, as any flammable materials were reduced to ash during the shattering.

### Miscellaneous

#### Vidrite

The name for the glass- or quartz-like substance that coats the walls of the canyons. Extremely hard and translucent, few have managed to chip a piece off to study it, and those who have closely guard their samples and findings. Almost always extremely smooth, looking like if glass had the gentle curves of a calm sea. Very difficult to climb, as it's nearly impossible to get any purchase. Claimed by some to be the ichor of Immog himself. Many scholars presume it to be ordinary stone created by the unique conditions surrounding Immog's shattering, though the lack of any obvious crystalline structure to it and the curved surfaces cause problems with this theory.

#### Heroes

This world has seen many adventurers, some of whose legacy can still be felt. Adventurers are usually called heroes, which takes on the meaning of "larger than life," someone who seems to have strange and unlikely experiences more than usual, and not necessarily a virtuous one. Fate seems to twist the odds in the areas around them causing unlikely occurrences to suddenly become very likely. Some people try to prove themselves worthy of fate, and others try to find heroes, those people in whom fate seems to take an interest, and use them for their gain, though fate has a way of striking back at those who try such things.

## Appendix B - Cultures and Civilizations

![](world-borders.png)

Capital cities are in red.

### The Divine Kingdom of Kithcaryn
Kingdom on the west of Evras ruled by the God-King of Kithcaryn (KITH-carn). Largest and oldest currently-standing regime on either continent, around 400 years old.Much of its domain was previously the Salasan empire, until The God-king defeated the evil emperor of Salasa, and renamed the place Kithcaryn. A haven for people of all species and creeds. Worship of other gods is allowed, though the churches to other gods tend to be fewer and smaller than in other lands. Worship of the more evil leaning gods is strictly allowed, but heavily frowned upon by most of the society, and rather rare. The divine kingdom frequent and large festivals all throughout the country, and values kindness, generosity and art. 

Located in an area of plains, prairies and forests all abounding with life, by far the most bountiful land on the continent. It has little desire to expand their borders or value in martial prowess, but is keen to spread their philosophy and worship of the God-King to other lands. Strong relations with the Wild Kingdom, as there is a mutual philosophy of generosity and helping one's peers, though the civilization vs. nature bit prevents anything more than strong ties. Many travellers to the kingdom and outsiders view the citizens of Kithcaryn as naive and coddled. The kingdom's borders are mostly open, due to their belief that all should aid and welcome each, but this can cause some strife as outsiders maintain their harsher ways of life within the kingdom.

The god Kithcaryn is unique in residing on the mortal plane. They rule their country directly from their palace in the city of Marroux. It is unknown who or what they were in their life before achieving godhood, as the god is always seen wearing armor made of an opaque sky-blue crystal. All that is known is that they are humanoid, as even reports of their height, from the few times non-priests are granted audiences, vary.

### The Free City of Liria 
Liria (LEER-ee-uh) is a city state on the north-eastern coast of Athol ruled by a cabal of wizards and sorcerors. Once the capital of Mikhesal, after the shattering a group of powerful magic users seized control. It is unknown where these mages came from, as with how powerful they were, they ought to have been at the battle if they hailed from Mikhesal. Opposed to warlocks, druids, clerics and most gods, as they do not wish to invite meddling by outside magical forces. The only magic allowed is innate or self-learned magic including the magic of bards, rangers, rogues and monks. The only gods allowed to be worshipped are those whom the cabal approves of - usually those gods with whom the leaders have spoken to and written up an explicit treaty, detailing what can be preached and what rites and magic can be invoked in the city. The leaders keep the true extent of their power as hidden as possible, but from what is known they could easily frustrate the schemes of gods, if not directly compete with some.

### The Federation of Caesal
In contrast to Liria, Caesal (KAY-sahl) is a free duchy founded by a mage-killer hero (Lilnia "Blink" Chaemenor, female half-elf) in the wake of the Shattering that is opposed to magic, including most gods. Located on the western edge of Athol and close to Evras, they believe magic and the gods is what has held mortals back from true greatness, and is the cause of the fall of civilizations, and their knowledge with them. The fall of Mikhesal which led to the founding of Caesal is prime evidence of this to the mind of most Caesalans.

Caesal is an oligarchy controlled by prominent scholars, and merchants, no nobility or aristocrats. Highly value philosophy, the sciences, engineering and physical prowess. Magic is allowed so long as it is in the pursuit of furthering the understanding of the world, not simply power. Caesalans views magic much like fire: extremely dangerous, volatile, and likely to cause destruction if left unchecked, but useful and worth the risk if controlled and used only with sufficient expertise. Licenses to practice magic and alchemy can be acquired through some difficulty. Clerics and warlocks can still acquire these licenses as the Caesalans are not opposed to leveraging gifts of power granted from outside sources, though some internal factions question the wisdom of this. Their strict control of magic within their borders is enforced by an elite force of mage-killers colloquially known as Blinkers, named after the founder's nickname of Blink. Lilnia got this nickname due to her extreme speed, use of stealth, and how the magical aura of her targets would simply blink out of existence

### The Wild Kingdom
A loose alliance of tribes and individuals of many species who value nature and reject large civilization, industry and agriculture. Located on central Athol with rather indistinct borders, it is comprised of humans, halflings, wood-elves, goliaths, bugbears, orcs, kobolds and various other naturalistic sentient species. The former 3 species tend to be the ambassadors to outside governments, being the most knowledgeable with the ways of organized civilization. A high king is elected by the leaders of each of the species majorly represented in the kingdom. While many citizens of the wild eat meat, killing other creatures is frowned upon, and the kingdom is a haven for many monsters so long as they do not harm any other sentient being. Harming other sentient creatures and needless destruction of nature are among the highest crimes in the kingdom.

Few travellers from the outside world visit the kingdom beyond the small villages and hamlets built by the more civilized citizens on the edge of the kingdom. The wild king does not extend their protection to visitors. Wild citizens will not be punished for attacking invadors from the civilized world, but neither will visitors be punished for defending themselves.

### The Kingdom of Frairus

(FRÈRE-us)The third and final kingdom of the two continents, located on the North-western edge of Evras. Technically the oldest kingdom, in that there has been some dynasty or the other (and occasionally multiple at once) claiming the name of Frairus for the last ~1000 years or so. Currently in power is the Lamorian dynasty, an offshoot of the prior dynasty in power that managed to usurp the throne in the kingdom's most recent civil war.

Frairus has little contact with the rest of Evras, let alone Athol. Separated from the rest of the nations by the monster-infested forest that marks their eastern border, Frairus mostly only has contact with the kingdom of Kithcaryn, their closest neighbour across the ocean. This leads to an inward facing society, competing mostly amongst itself. Frairan society is extremely stratified, though extreme ambition is a fire that burns throughout every rung of the Frairan ladder. Frairan competition extends to fields such as the arts, the sciences, and magecraft, competing both amongst themselves and the few exploits from other nations they hear about. Said other nations largely consider Frairan contributions middling at best, Frairan competition and backstabbing often getting in the way of the true potential of the work. Although, there is a near uninimous acknowledgement of  Frairus' supremacy in the art of scheming.

### The Commonwealth of Uskia

(OOS-key-uh) The northernmost duchy of the two continents, located on the stretch of land known as The Bridge, the northern coast of the dancing sea that connects the two continents to each other, as well as the Astham expanse and the rest of the super-continent to the north. Uskia is officially considered to be part of Evras, being on the northwestern edge of the bridge. Depending on which account one believes, Uskia is the oldest nation still standing on either Athol or Evras, having been a collection of independant backwater town for several centuries, escaping the notice of would-be conquerors by simply being out of the way of everything. For the last handful of centuries Uskia has organized itself into a centralized duchy of sorts, though mostly for the sake of other nations trying to classify it, as it slowly has joined the larger affairs of the two continents.

Uskia is known as a land of lax rules, despite having a formal government of sorts. For the most part Uskians tend to fend for themselves, dealing with issues on a local scale either by debate, and village councils or sheriffs. This lack of organization, the duchy is really only defined for the sake of outsiders who are often confused by the Uskian laxness, results in Uskia simultaneously being one of the nations most inclusive of all species, yet also the place where members of different species are the most separated from each other. Since Uskia has never been a place where civilization has been forced upon the people, the duchy ends up organizing itself into towns and villages where only a couple different species are represented, and many villages are mono-species. Uskian cities are few, and even the Uskian "capital" is barely large enough to be considered a small trader town by the standards of other nations, as it mostly exists for the benefit of those other nations.

### The Dominion of Karlsa

(CARL-sah) Duchy controlling the Evrasian side of the golden strait. One of the richest states due to their taxation of commerce through the golden strait, though their treaty with Farashna forces them to share more than the Karlsan nobility might like. Up until around 200 years ago Karlsa controlled both banks of the strait and a monopoly on commerce on the dancing sea because of it. One morning the lone Karlsan city on the Atholian side seemed to have been destroyed in an instant. 

The discoverers of the calamity reported even the greatest buildings had been smashed to pieces, yet the damage looked old, decades past if anything, and no bodies were ever found. Only a few short years after the destruction, before Karlsa had been able to do recover and rebuild the city, a flock of various peoples from every corner of the two continents converged on the ruined city, founding the free city of Farashna.

### The Free City of Farashna

(far-ASH-na) City state controlling the Atholian side of the golden strait, founded some 200 years past on the ruins of the earlier Karlsan city. Has some of the smallest borders of any state on either continent, yet infamous for being extremely militaristic, producing peer;essly skilled warriors in huge numbers. Nearly every citizen, regardless of class or gender, train with multiple weapons starting from childhood. Children of Farashnan noble families often master at least one weapon before adulthood, if not more. Martial ability is central to Farashnan society, even for their scholars and mages. Duels are common, though almost never to the death.

The city was founded on the ruins of a Karlsan city that was destroyed instantaneously in some unknown catastrophe. Soon after the city of Farashna was build almost as quickly, though almost exclusively by people not native to the region. Farashnans, while welcoming of travellers, are famously secretive about their city, refusing to answer any questions about its founding or its culture. Many outsiders are puzzled by the Farashnan devotion to combat in contrast to the city's lack of interest in expanding their borders. When asked, Farashnans will simply say "we must train."

### The Vrokricurion Dukedom

Duchy on the south-western edge of Athol, on the coast of the widest part of the dancing sea. Often abbreviated to Vrok (rhymes with broke). Due to it's proximity to the ice plains to the south it's considered a hard-bitten land of tough earth and the heaviest snows known to both continents. Despite all this, Vrokricurion is a land teeming with wildlife in its dense and large forests, and it's people are known to be cheerful no matter how bad things are. Per the general Vrokricurion sentiment, there is not much in life that is worth worrying about when compared to a particularly bad winter. 

The Vrokcricurion are a proud people apparently friendly to many other peoples, but openly dismissive of them among other Vrok. They are a people who are quick to help each other, yet also deep believers in self-sufficiency, taking pride in every bit of hard-earned accomplishment. To them, all foreign lands are paradises of gentle winters and easy harvests, due to which the Vrokricurion consider themselves tougher and more worthy than nearly anyone else.

### The Free City of Camzon

Landlocked city-state to the south of the Shattered God's Tomb. Situated on a terrain of extremely steep hills, and extremely flat plains. Formerly a border fortress of the Mikhesal empire, the commander of the fort seized control of the surrounding land and villages as soon as news of the Shattering reached the fort, declaring the fort's independance. Since then the fort was turned into a city, though its military origins are clearly visible.

Despite the fortress commander's quick thinking to seize power, Camzon is not a domain many would choose to rule. Mostly dry hills and desert, the state barely survives on its little grass and farmland, being too far from other nations to have much trade. In recent years many Camzonites have left the city to seek better fortune elsewhere, leaving the place slowly dwindling.

### The Free City of Breyze

A small, mostly forested duchy, Breyze (BRISE, rhymes with surprise) is a land known simply for quiet and tranquility. A temperate land of mild summers and winters, Breyze is often remarked to be almost timeless by visitors. Tucked away in a small bay, Breyze has little involment with affairs on the continental scale. Once a small port in the Salasan empire, the Breyze requested their independance from Kithcaryn shortly after the God-king ascended, which was granted. Breyzians are a self-sufficient people, mostly living simple lives without using up too many resources. Though a small population, Breyze are nevertheless renowned around the world as premiere artists of all kinds, painters, poets, dancers, and so on. Breyzian work is much sought after by nobles of many nations, though famously hard to acquire.

### The Dominion of Azuros

The easternmost edge of the known world, it's hard to say if Azuros (ah-ZURE-ohs) is a unified duchy or a collection of feuding city states, as the situation seems to change monthly. Comprised of four major cities: Skoro, Melala, Darham, and Lystus. Formerly cities of the Mikhesal empire, the nobles of what would become Azuros were quick to form an alliance in the power vaccuum that followed the Shattering. The Alliance soon fell victim to internal bickering before they could establish control over any other former Mikhesal lands, most notably the nearby Mikhesal capital which later became Liria, and to this day have never gotten around to expanding their borders.

Azuros has yet to see a true civil war in its history, but the state of Azuran unity or rebellion seems to change faster than the winds. Azurans have come to be known for their love of words and wordplay, as well as their stubborness and long-windedness. Asking an Azuran about their day is likely to involve no less than an hour's conversation, which several things that sound vaguely like veiled insults thrown in.

### The City of Galward

(GAUL-ward) City state located on a peninsula on the southwestern edge of Evras, just north of the ice plains. Remote and having little contact with the outside world, little is known of Galward. Traders from the city are rare, only occasionally visiting Kithcaryn, and even then their offerings are hopelessly mundane, often rough-hewn idols of their gods, sour wine and threadbare pelts. Few Evrasians have ever visited the city, and fewer are the stories they feel interesting enough to tell. By and large  One wonders why anyone would make such a long journey to trade such meager goods.

## Appendix C - Other Geography

### The Dancing Sea

The body of salt water separating Athol and Evras. Many cities and duchies are located on its shores, as the lands on either side are bountiful. Much trade flows through the sea, though most sailors choose to hug the coast to avoid the huge waves which gave it its name, not to mention the monsters and the numerous volcanic islands.

### The Golden Strait

The narrow stretch of water separating the northern and southern section of the Dancing Sea. More than a dozen battles have been fought over control of the straight throughout the millenia, as anyone who does can control all trade between the north and south.

### The Astham Expanse

The huge swath of uninhabited grassland and savannah north of Uskia. The occasional trader or explorer from unknown kingdoms from the far north find their way down through the expanse, though few Atholians or Evrasians ever bother to venture in search of whatever might be up there, as it's known as a singularly uninteresting land of sparse and tough grass, interspersed only by deserts.

### The Wild

Though there are many cities on Evras and Athol, the land between any two nations is often untamed and uncharted, the domain of beasts and monsters. Two nations sharing a border is the exception, rather than the rule. Forests, mountains and deserts force civilization to live in bubbles on plains and shores. 

The Wild Kingdom of Athol exists as an anomaly, the only piece of the wild known to have some sense of order. Other areas are thought to either be empty of sentient beings, or else the territory of more tribal peoples; orcs, goliath, lizardfolk, goblins & hobgoblins, and possibly stranger and more unknown creatures.
