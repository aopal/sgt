# session 3

- open on having just finished off the grick
  - Skip the dust mephit encounter, enough combat has been had especially with the earth spirit still to come
- Eventually find the earth spirit's lair
  - See that page for description
- Spirit is just starting the ritual to entomb Rorvun
  - In a sort of trance, so it didn't hear the thunderclash and can easily be stealthed on (DC 5)
- fight the thing, see [here](../Monsters/earth-spirit.md) for stat block
  - Rewards which can be found strewn about the lair: a bunch of old weapons (swords, axes, spears, bows), slightly spotted with rust. One sword is gleaming brilliantly, polished to a near mirror sheen, with a small gemstone in the pommel and noticeable craftsmanship. With an investigation roll DC 14 they can find 18GP and 40SP strewn about
    - If they bring the sword to the town blacksmith he recognizes it as craftsmanship from the Mikhesal empire. "Expertly balanced, light as a feather and barely ever needs sharpening from the enchantments on it. By the engraving on the tang, this was the weapon of a rank-and-file corporal, second in command to a squadron of less than a dozen soldiers in the Mikhesal army. By your standards, the person who wielded this sword could hardly fight worth half a damn."
    - Sword is a +2 longsword dealing 1d6+2 slashing damage + 1d6 radiant damage. 
- Free Rorvun, none of the other prisoners are rescueable
  - Rorvun introduces himself as a Caesalan bounty hunter extraodinaire, having single handedly defeated and captured the notorious Diamond Bulls gang. "Got any debtors you need hunted down, or any kneecaps you need broken, Rorvun's your man." As an afterthought he mentions "oh, well I'm currently an acolyte of the priests of Ebor here in Hope's Rock. Almost forgot about that bit"
    - Hopefully Carter takes the bait and asks about Bowstring
- Rorvun gives them their first solid lead on Bowstring: the exact location of one of her hidey-hole
  - yes, one of. He has reason to believe she has at least one other
    - [insert really obvious logic that Rorvun thinks he's a genius for figuring out]
  - As soon as Whistle says something like "I'm looking for this kenku/my sibling," Rorvun immediately makes the connection and says "Oh, you're Bowstring's sibling?"
  - Rorvun met Bowstring when he was investigating what looked to be a small monster den, but was actually Bowstring's hideout. An arrow came out of nowhere and pinned Rorvun's cloak to the rock wall
  - Rorvun offers to mark the locations of the two of Bowstring's hidey-holes he knows on a map...which none of them own as yet
- Party (presumably) heads back to town with the injured Rorvun
  - They can follow the tracks that led them to the cavern, as none of them have a map
- Siril intercepts them just as they enter the town, welcoming his fellow dragonslayers, and offering to buy them a drink 
  - Rorvun tells him to fuck off
- Drop Rorvun off at the house where the priests of ebor live, a small cavern on demon's lane, not too far from the shaggy alligator
  - If they accept his invitation inside, they'll meet Steel Crash and Ormen
    - Steel Crash gives the group a wave as they enter, but doesn't get up to greet them (is oiling a bow)
    - Ormen is in full armor, having just finished training with Steel Crash outside the city
      - Casts a higher level healing spell on Rorvun, fully healing his leg
      - Thanks the group for helping Rorvun, though he isn't really able to give them a reward beyond offering training
      - Does offer that they can use the place as at least a temporary home, as there are a couple spare cots in the back
      - He does inquire if the party would be willing to help out the priests: he's not asking them to convert, merely offering to pay, in housing and possibly gold/materials/weapons, for any information they have that might help him find the remains of Immog in the tomb
- They probably ought to inform Jemar that they found and killed the beast
  - He'll inquire as to what the hell it was, and why it was kidnapping people
  - He'll believe that they dealt with it, especially when they inform him that they brought Rorvun back
    - He isn't usually so trusting of the adventurers in this town, but from the dinner he thinks they're a bit naive and unlikely to lie to him
  - If they brought back the earth spirit's body he'll offer them 800 gold for it
    - If they haggle or say "well we were thinking of keeping it as a trophy" he'll go as high as 1000, but stop there
- If they get a map and meet back up with Rorvun to find out where Bowstring's hideouts are, they'll get the two map markers revealed. They may just barely have time to reach the close one, though they'd likely have to plan to spend the night there if they go today vs. the next morning
  - Whichever one they go to, they'll need an investigation roll DC 13 to find the entrance, as they are both hidden with a grid of sticks covered in moss, likely to hide from both monsters and other adventurers
  - Inside is a small cave around 10-15 feet in diameter, small enough to be lit from the outside light
    - There's a bedroll on the ground, some rocks arranged in what looks to be a desk and stool, two daggers, a bow and a quiver.
    - There's a small box containing some dried rations and waterskins
    - The desk rock has a few pieces of parchment on it, which seem to be maps of the canyon network, at a much higher resolution than the map they have, likely drawn from exploring the canyons on foot
      - If they try to compare these maps with their map, they'll notice some lines in a different colour than the rest, that don't exist on their map
      - There are some doodles on the edges of the maps, including what look like a forest, another kenku, and [instrument whistle plays]
      - There is also what looks to be a hand-whittled flute, or other woodwind instrument
