# Whistle-Through-A-Quiet-Woods

Most kenku live in cities, but their reputation as thieves or a cursed people gives them a bad rap. Whistle's family left for the Wild Kingdom about two generations back, eschewing city life for the relative haven of the woods. They joined the Wild Flock living there and set about making new lives for themselves.

The lack of a written language means that oral folklore is king when it comes to creating lasting records and history. All tribes in the Wild Kingdom have their own tradition, and Whistle took up the call for his--equal parts storyteller, living record keeper, and occasional translator at formal intertribal meetings. He's taken up the role with gusto, under the tutelage of his aunt, Cacophony-Of-Argument (Cacophony for short). He's very much expected to take over her position as chief bard when she retires (or more likely, passes on).

Several months ago, his older sister Bowstring-Snapped-In-Two ran away. This wasn't unexpected, members of the Wild Flock frequently come and go, traveling with other friendly tribes who might require their services. The fact that she failed to tell anyone who she was going with was perhaps a little rude, but not alarming. What was alarming was when she wasn't with any of the usual suspects, and when she didn't appear at a holiday reunion, Whistle and his family began trying to figure out where she'd run off to. There was gossip about a kenku woman heading for the Shattered God's Tomb, and while Whistle knows the odds are slim, he's determined to try to find her and bring her back home.


# Bowstring-Snapped-In-Two
Class: Ranger
Very quiet, but physically intense person, her name came from an incident where she was helping hunt down a rabid wolf and pulled off a desperate volley of shots that felled the wolf but destroyed her weapon. Not outwardly restless (not in any way the family noticed), but certainly intensely curious and persistent. Whistle looked up to her, for her self-assured nature and calm head in a crisis.


# Cacophony-Of-Argument
Class: Bard
Old and venerable kenku, held the Chief Bard position for close to 30 years now. Not necessarily the best teacher, as all her patience gets used up dealing with social politicking and she has none left for fledgling antics, but Whistle’s gained prodigious respect for her as they’ve both grown older and learned how to relate to each other.
