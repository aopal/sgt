# Earth Spirit's Lair

## Approach
- Cavern located on the hourglass-looking plate. Out the gate on Beholder's Boulevard, first right, left at the T junction, right, then on one's left about two-thirds of the way to the next intersection
- The party doesn't have these directions, instead find it by following the tracks the spirit left.
  - Very long taloned feet taking large strides (15 feet between each track). Tracks are decently deep, especially at the front, as if all the weight was on the balls of the feet and the toes/talons. Occasionally see two foot prints together followed by tracks vanishing for nearly 50 feet, before another pair of prints together, very deep in the earth. The normal tracks occasionally dissapear when the ground gets tougher (or entirely whn on bare rock), but the indentations from the landing of the creature's leap are easy to spot and pick up the trail again
- About a 3-4 hour walk from town
  - Party encounter some wandering monsters along the way, a pair of nothics just chilling in the canyon on the east side of hourglass shaped plate
  - Players may also notice small animals on their way: lizards, snakes, toads, the occasional small bird, etc. and the occasional small puddle of stagnant water. Notably nothing furred or mamalian looking. On close inspection none of them will recognize the species, though they do all look fairly mundane, not alien.
  - Occasionally also hear things in other caverns they pass (about 5-6), hopefully they don't go in any of them. Do see the shadow of something flying over them at one point, but its too high up and the sun is in their eyes so they can't make out what it is (could be a hawk/eagle, could be another dragon). They do hear hawk-like screeches every now and then

## Dungeon
- Medium brightness, orbs of yellow crystals occur haphazardly on the walls. Players without darkvision can see, though there are pockets of shadow, and the light is very yellow
- Ceiling ~30 feet up
- ground looks like sandstone, there are a couple pools of water here and there (extremely clear and untainted, very drinkable). Many large stalagmites and stalactites, water dripping and flowing can be heard, as well as the shuffling of larger creatures
- Each small square is 5x5 feet


## Layout
- Players enter to room 5, empty except for some small animals (lizards, bats). 
- Room 4 contains a grick near the northwest wall. Grick will smell the party and try to stealth and attack them for invading its territory
- Room 1 contains a horde of 4 dust mephits, which may join the grick encounter if it moves far enough south east
- Room 3 is empty save for some miscellaneous bones
- Room 2 is the earth spirit's lair. Notably different from the rest of the dungeon, walls look much more rough hewn and a decent amount of rubble strewn about, ranging from gravel size to human torso size.
  - Many pools of clear water in this chamber, and many stone pillars that look almost like large arms grasping 10-foot orbs of the same material as the ones giving light. These orbs do not glow, and instead appear to contain corpses of various creatures in various stages of fossilization/crystalization. Some creatures look humanoid, though some with extra limbs or other oddities, while many are just other small-ish monsters. All appear to have some kind of grey stone nailing them to the base of their orb, about the size of a railway spike. Older corpses are near the entrance, the oldest just skeletons with rock growing on them. None of the corpses appear to be rotting, the newer ones look as if their softer tissues were sucked out of them, with crystaline growths reaching up from where they were nailed. Some of the most recent ones are 3 miners from the town and one of the guards from the northern gate. Even the guard is already dead, having visibly sagged from his nutrients being absorbed by the earth
  - Near the back they spot the earth spirit and Rorvun nailed to the ground, not yet in an orb. The spirit is casting some kind of ritual spell that slowly grows an orb of yellow crystal out of the ground, followed, by stone fingers emerging from the ground, grasping the orb, and slowly raising it into the air. Rorvun is unconscious, but still wearing his armor and weapons.
