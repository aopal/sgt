# A concise intro to D&D

Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is what is known as a "Table Top Role Playing Game," you can think of it as a mix between the fantastical adventures kids make up, and the number crunching of mid-twentieth century wargames. In essence, the players in a game of D&D play the role of a set of adventurers making their way through a fantasy world, meeting various characters and fighting monsters. However, where the childhood game of make believe a player might say ""

## People involved

In a game there will be several players who act as individual character, and one special player called the dungeon master (DM). The DM runs just about everything else about the story: they will play the role of any and every character the 

## Roleplay and combat

It's not a perfect model, but in general D&D consists of 2 main phases: roleplay segments where players interact with non-player characters or do things like sneaking into a noble's manor, and combat where players fight things.

"Races" are a bunch of racial coding that the inventors of D&D borrowed from Tolkien because, surprise, they were also white. In terms of game mechanics, races give you a bit more specialization on top of your class: each race has some abilities and gives some increases to certain attribute scores (which we'll get to). Some races can see better in the dark, some can move faster, some have resistance to poison, and some races are stronger or smarter than others.

### Alignment

Alignment is the first piece to deciding who your character is as a person.
