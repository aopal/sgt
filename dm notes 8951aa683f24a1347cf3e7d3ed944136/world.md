# World

<!-- ![World Map](candidate.png)

Assuming Equirectangular projection.

World is 174*87 hexes, each hex is then approximately 2.057 degrees in height and width (2 degrees, 2 arc minutes, 25.71 arc seconds or 35.9 milliradians). Works out to 229 km across at the equator, or 162 km across at 45$$\degree$$ north, using earth radius. -->

<!-- ## Legend

![World Map](candidate.png)
Each hex 15 miles between parallel edges. Map roughly 100 * 60 hexes. About 930 miles north-south.

Eastern continent - Athol. People called Atholians.

Western continent - Evras. People called Evrasians.

World is about the size of Earth's moon. At that scale , 930 miles is the distance from the northern edge of BC to the tropic of cancer, or about 50 degrees. This is the angle between the southern tip of England and the equator, or the distance between the southern edge of Cuba and the northern edge of Mainland Canada (Northern coast of the Yukon).

Southern edge of the map is the 70th parallel south, and the northen bit is the 20th, roughly analogous to northern Yukon and Maharashtra respectively.
