# session 1

- intro: supply caravan approaching the Upper Rock of the shattered god's tomb. The Hope and the lift are immediately noticeable
- Party (presumably) wanders through town towards the lift. They are pressured into taking the lift ASAP, while the cargo is being unloaded and inspected
- Meets and chats with Derik, and the lift conveniently arrives at the top as soon as that conversation finishes. Derik hints at some stuff

- Exit the lift, meet Zatari. Learn about the fees. 
	- May learn how they're enforced, if they're gutsy enough to try and intimidate her

- Exit the waystation, go wherever they'd like.
