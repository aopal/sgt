# session 1

- intro: supply caravan approaching the Upper Rock of the shattered god's tomb. 
- The caravan left from a border town on the southern edge of Caesal. The party joined the caravan as guards, in return for free passage and food until Hope's Rock.
- Open on late morning, the front of the train calls out as they sight the town after cresting a hill. The Hope and the lift are immediately noticeable, the Hope glinting in the sunlight, and the lift audible as the party gets closer.
- As they enter town, the party passes a welcome sign reading: "Welcome to Hope's Rock!" with the tagline "Where adventure 
	- On the bottom of the sign is a population listing. Several numbers have been painted on and crossed out. A piece of paper seems to be the most recent tally, though even that is visibly yellowed and water damaged from age and the elements
- The caravan enters the town and rolls to a stop. A gnome with a clipboard approaches and furiously starts writing notes, advising the party to take the lift while the cargo is being inventoried and unloaded, before they're forced to wait for all the cargo to be transported, which could take all of today and much of tomorrow.
- Party (presumably) wanders through town towards the lift. There's not really much to pique their interest, only a handful of homes and administrative buildings, not even a general store or an inn. They are pressured into taking the lift ASAP, while the cargo is being unloaded and inspected
- Meets and chats with Derik, and the lift conveniently arrives at the top as soon as that conversation finishes. Derik hints at some stuff e.g. people not taking the lift very often (ostensibly because it's a long ride), "why not toss poor ol' Derik a gold coin when you're leaving this place richer than a king"
- Ride the lift down, describe the walls of the canyons. Any adventurer with a high enough passive perception notices Immog's heartbeat
- Exit the lift and meet Zatari, who's at a counter beneath a sign reading "arrivals". Learn about the fees. 
	- May learn how they're enforced, if they're gutsy enough to try and intimidate her
	- If they try to persuade her, she makes a big show of looking up applicable discounts in a booklet, which a party member might notice is full of blank pages, from which she'll give a maximum discount of 5 sp
- Exit the waystation, go wherever they'd like.
	- Meet Bari in the town square? She leads them to the Giant's Burrow where they meet Saelfine
