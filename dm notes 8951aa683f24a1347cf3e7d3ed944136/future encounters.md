## Encounters

- Pack of monsters of some kind attack one of the gates, party helps fight them off with the guards/other characters
  - Make this more of a tactics battle than just a melee: lots of cover what with all the mining rubble that's strewn outside the gates, standing on top of the gate is an option for ranged characters
  - This one will definitely need a battle map
  - 12 bugbears, keep stats the same, give 400 exp each instead of 200 (will get the party up to level 4). They don't engage all at once, instead a few hide behind rocks and huck javelins, joining the fray later. Most only armed with javelins, 3 elites have morningstars
  - Party aided by generic town guards and some of the priests of ebor - Ormen and Steel crash?
  - max 3-4 actually engage the party at once, the rest deal with the other combatants
  - One of them is carrying a heavily enchanted Mikhesal weapon
- Rumours of an earth spirit kidnapping people. Puzzle dungeon ending in the titanfolly spirit's lair, many corpses encased in yellow glass orbs, party arrives when the spirit is struggling to put Rorvun in an orb. The corpses seem to be slowly being taken over by the earth, as if it is feeding on them. The oldest bodies, the ones near the entrance, appear to have become partially fossilized, yet with rotting flesh still visible above the stone line. None of the corpses are from Hope's Rock, some are visibly wearing clothes or have weapons from different eras
  - Maybe it's bowstring, whistle's sister, instead of Rorvun?
- Party is travelling down one of the canyons, and when turning a corner are just in time to see a k'ell hunter skewer a wyrmling through its torso, getting its sword stuck in the rock below. The pack leader sniffs them out (unless really high stealth roll), and the pack comes charging
  - pack of 3, and the hunter who got the kill doesn't join for a couple rounds (needs to get its sword out of the ground)?
    - Alternate: path of 3, but one visibly died fighting the dragon, and the one that got the kill is heavily wounded
  - Alternate: the party sees a hunter slice off the wing of a wyrmling as it tries to escape, and finishes with the torso skewering
  - Alternate: the hunter slices open the wyrmling's belly as it tries to fly away, it crashes to the ground, dead, a few feet in front of whatever the party is hiding behind
- Gazer stronghold. The inside of the cavern starts as a small, natural looking corridor but exits into a room that is perfectly rectangular, with walls made out of some unknown grey material that feels halfway between rock and metal. There are a bunch of tables and bookshelves in the room, but notably no chairs. Light appears to be coming from the ceiling, but it's impossible to tell exactly from where. All the books and miscellaneous pieces of paper on the tables are in an unrecognizable language. In one corner of the room there is a door that opens effortlessly to a much smaller room, where two gazers can be found, who immediately attack. The small room houses what looks to be an altar of unknown origin or deity, with glowing runes of the same script as the books in the main room on the walls. Whatever is written on the wall is done so in the shape of a sinusoidal wave.


## Unique monsters

### The titanfolly spirit

A grey, roughly humanoid creature hunched over, its torso and head covered in heavy armor that looks almost like terracotta. Tusked, with fur poking out from under the armor. Many beady red eyes, long, thin arms and legs that that don't seem to have any joints, wobbling like pieces of rope or tentacle, yet still ending in elongated hands and feet.

Its limbs will be severed if hit with any attack that does at least 3 damage. If it is missing one leg its movement drops to 15+0, and cannot move if missing both. An attack that does less than 3 damage punches visible holes, and decreases the amount of damage needed to sever the limb by the damage dealt

Slashing attack: The spirit attacks with one of its arms, telescoping them out and turning its fingers into talons, +6 to hit dealing (dex) 2d6 + 3 slashing damage. This attack has a range of 60 feet, but deals half damage to targets <= 20 feet away.
Throwing attack: The spirit grabs a target and tosses them against a nearby wall. The target must make a dc 13 dex save, taking 4d6  damage on a failed save. Cannot grab targets further than 40 feet away, and the wall must be within 40 feet of the target.
regrow (max once per 2 turns, cannot regrow a limb the turn after it was lost): the spirit regrows a limb entirely, taking 7 damage in the process
Alternate throwing attack: Spirit throws a target at another creature. Both must make a dc 13 dex save, taking 2d6 damange on a failed save. Same range restrictions as the normal throw
