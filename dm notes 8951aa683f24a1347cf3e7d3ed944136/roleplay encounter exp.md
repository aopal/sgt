## RP EXP

idea: grant exp for roleplay encounters to up the exp gain a bit

Any notable encounters has a base exp level, many are 0. If the party meets expectations they gain that amount of exp, and gain 0.5x or 1.5x if they do not meet, or exceed expectations respectively.

Party can gain bonus exp for any particularly insighful roleplayin in any encounter, in increments of 100 exp, scaled for their level.
