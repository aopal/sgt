# A little bit of thievery
## Att-Mattan variant

### Changes
- Have some Monodrones (constructs with truesight) in the manor. Hint at them by mentioning that there are some sort of small copper orbs floating in the air near the ceiling
  - if the players attempt to use some sort of illusion without disabling the drones somehow they'll alert lord Barrister
  - These are only in the main hall, not things like bathrooms or the gardens
- The locked chest in Lord Barrister's bedroom will also contain his signet ring, which they might use to forge something of use
- Increase CR of guards/Cirn/Lord Barrister
  - Cirn: gladiator
  - Barrister: Meletian hoplite, reduce AC to 14 if combat is unexpected (not the duel)
  - Guards: Cr 1/2-1, mix of soldier (replace formation tactics with pack tactics) & 3 mages (evil mage statblock)
  - bandits on the road to the party: leader is black viper, two helpers use thug statblock
- If they are captured, Barrister will still want to question them assuming they were hired by someone who has it out for him.
  - They can still try to escape of course, either somehow fighting/sneaking their way out of the guardhouse (the guard nearest them will fall asleep after about an hour, and they can try to steal the keys), or they might notice the draft coming through the weak wall and try to escape that way
  - His first assumption will be that the King noticed that Barrister was becoming a threat and wanted to tarnish his reputation, though won't let this on immediately. If the players lie and confirm this, he'll offer to hire them, because if they were good enough to almost steal from him with no planning, then he might have use for their skills
  - If they truthfully say they're working for Martas (if they figure that out), Barrister won't know who they're talking about at first
  - They'll have a medium-difficult time convincing him that they don't actually know who they're working for, that a fixer contacted them
  - If they don't take his deal they'll have no choice but to try and escape
- Some of the party guests will be other of my PCs
  - including: the tabaxi pirate grandpa, warforged + plasmoid pretending to be a regular human, loxodon with oversized instrument
  - pirate grandpa will be willing to help the players out, he'll make some offhand comments about how neat some of the stuff Barrister has is, and how his grandkids would love them
- The case containing the raven has an alarm spell on it (unless the players have no way of detecting this)
  - This can be disabled in a number of ways: the spell is cast by inscribing a glyph into the stand, which the players might remove in some way. Touching the stand doesn't activate the alarm, but removing the glass would.
  - illusion magic can mask or eliminate the sound
  - the silence spell would similarly mask the sound
  - knocking the case over instead of actively opening it will not trigger the alarm on a technicality
- The raven's worth is upped to 5000 GP. Cyrus will still only offer them 100 gp to start, condescending to them as if they really were level 1 characters
  - The raven is now a figure of wondrous power, serpentine owl
- There are some real ravens out in the gardens, in the trees



### distraction methods
- challenge lord Barrister to a duel
  - this will be 1-on-1 combat against a meletian hoplite (choose a statblock)
  - If they try to dig up rumors on lord barrister they'll find out
- The noblewoman they (may) save on the way to the party will be a renowned opera singer, they can cash in their favor to get her to do an impromptu performance
- They might be able to bribe one of the guards, all of whom look obviously bored as the night wears on
  - They were all soldiers during Lord barrister's campaigning days, and now they're just glorified manservants, and particularly resentful of that



### other methods of getting the raven
- find lord Barrister's signet ring and forge something?
- if they go through his desk they might find evidence that he's been conspiring against the king - which could be used for blackmail
