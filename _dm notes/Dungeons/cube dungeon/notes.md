This is actually an old temple to Immog, but the space has been warped, leading to a non euclidean geometry. there are occasionally doors to nowhere, and halls that end in blank walls

Wandering the catacombs are
- 3 giant spiders
  - they're in stealth walking along the ceiling, all in a group
- a basilisk
  - It's been hibernating in here after it tunnelled in, causing the chapel to be abandoned. As soon as they enter the catacombs they'll start noticing figure that have been turned to stone, either fleeing or covering their eyes

All the doors into the deeper catacombs are locked. The doors are old enough to conceivably be broken (20 hp), or picked (DC 14)
- the one exception is the big room in section 2. None of these doors are locked, it's protected by the puzzle room to the west
- The players can find a set of keys if they search around the old living quarters

section 1:
- room at the top left is an autopsy room, with a couple other coffins. There is a naked skeleton on the autopsy table, investigation will yield that it looks like this place was abandoned in haste. It looks like there was some kind of ceremonial dagger used to apply some kind of ward onto the corpses interred here
- room at the middle left is an old cellar. There are a couple barrels of wine and some fungus growing on what may have once been potatoes and onions. There's a strong smell of alcohol (there's some extremely high quality vodka to be found here). There is a locked door into the catacombs
- catacombs contain various coffins embedded into the walls.
  - The giant spiders will attack the party here
- room in the bottom right: two torches still lit with a magical blue fire. An ornate coffin is interred hereup a small flight of stairs
  - If the party opens the coffin they'll find the corpse of a knight (paladin). The weapons armor and shield are rotted away, but they'd be able to get a medallion of thoughts here. The shield bears the old sigil of Immog, a dragon's fang wreathed in fire

section 2:
- room on the left holds 3 coffins, and a large mirror completely covering the wall opposite. Unless the party notices a trapped pressure plate (DC 15), the doors lock behind them upon entering. If they investigate carefully they'll notice that there's a small metal orb lying on the ground that is in the room but not visible in the mirror, and a small pedestal in one corner that only appears in the mirror. Putting the orb on the pedestal, which the players cannot see or feel but the orb can interact with, unlocks the doors
- Room to the right of that looks to be an old armory and training ground. there are a variety of weapons strewn about, including a handful of +1 magic weapons (mostly daggers and swords - the party probably has better gear already)

section 3:
- long hallway that leads to stairs to the cellar. This hallway is enchanted so that it appears that you never move forward (solution is walking backwards).
  - If they solve the puzzle they'll get to the crossroads: there's an alcove to the left containing what appears to be brewing supplies (for making beer), the stairs to the cellar in front of them, and a door to a chamber containing the coffins of several old high priests of Immog
- Room to the left of the dining hall is a small kitchen
- Large catacomb room contains the basilisk. It will be asleep if they're in stealth, will wake up if it hears them in range however

section 4:
- coffin in top right contains a deathlock, who will creep out of it's coffin unless the party is in stealth
  - This coffin is noticeably given the most importance in these catacombs, on a raised dais and a chamber actually cut with precision
  - Raise AC to 16, HP to 72-80 and add charisma modifier to eldritch blasts
  - drop invisibility for fireball
  - if defeated, will be able to loot a staff of healing
- Central room: 
  - Small cathedral to Immog. Rotted pews line the sides of the room, and there's a small shrine down a half-level flight of steps, a statue of a dragon, wings spread and roaring, on a plinth, with various offerings strewn about (gold, jewelry, weapons, rotted flowers).
  - Rooms to the left and right of this just show the portaits of various people interred in the catacombs. The paintings are visibly in a variety of styles/eras, all visibly worn and dirty with age. what figures can be made out are clearly recognizable as races from the world the party knows

section 5:
- 2x potion of speed, labeled, in the room with two coffins. They're next to the remains of what may have once been flowers, and some kind of drawing but extremely realistic
  - if taken, two ghasts wake up 
- Room before that is a small library, most books being rotted
- Room on the top right is a small dungeon, with an empty cell but bars and chains visible

section 6:
- (cont in section 3): old dining hall, covered in cobwebs with tarnished silver plates and cutlery. Many empty, cold sconces line the walls, but can be lit
  - secret door leading to hallway behind. hinted at by a slight breeze in the room, there's a button under the table reachable if you sit at the head of the table. entering the hallway this way prevents the endless corridor puzzle
- Party will enter into an old foyer, mosaics depicting ancient battles on the wall, with a great dragon watching from the heavens. Door to the north leads to the chapel in section 4, west leads to the dining hall 
  - room to the east is a small living room once used by priests.
    - Room to the south of that is a small living quarters with cramped bunks 
- Room to the south of the dining hall is a prayer room. Several old incense burners can be found here, depictions of Immog on the wall, and an illuminated book on a pedestal, still open
