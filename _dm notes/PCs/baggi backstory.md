# Baggi

Baggi was adopted by an Orcish noble and moved between tribes when young.

Against the attempts of an pure Orcish Queen to assert her dominance over the Orcish tribes of the northern Wild Kingdom, Baggi led a coalition of Half-Orcs to stir insubordination, and faced off against the Queen with their fire magic.

After the duel sent into exile the Queen and her loyal troops, Baggi likewise left the tribes for the Shattered God's Tomb, to let peace settle among the tribes and solidify the place of the Halves. 

As well, Baggi strives to finally uncover their heritage and draconic lineage amongst the dragon god's ruins.
