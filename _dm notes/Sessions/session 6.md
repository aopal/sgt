# Session 6

- party finds one of bowstring's hideouts
  - On the path to whichever one they go to, they will hear some howling & barking ahead of them. As they approach, they'll find a small pack of 4 direwolves
    - next to the hounds is the corpse of a rhinoceros (need a survival/nature roll to figure that out), as well as one dead wolf 
    - the survivors are somewhat wounded, all at 5-10 below max HP
  - Whichever one they go to, they'll need an investigation or perception roll DC 13 (passive 16) to find the entrance, as they are both hidden with a grid of sticks covered in moss, likely to hide from both monsters and other adventurers
  - Inside is a small cave around 12-15 feet in diameter, small enough to be lit from the outside light
    - There's a bedroll on the ground, some rocks arranged in what looks to be a desk and stool, two daggers, a bow and a quiver.
    - There's a small box containing some dried rations and waterskins
    - The desk rock has a few pieces of parchment on it, which seem to be maps of the canyon network, at a much higher resolution than the map they have, likely drawn from exploring the canyons on foot
      - If they try to compare these maps with their map, they'll notice some lines in a different colour than the rest, that don't exist on their map
      - There are some doodles on the edges of the maps, including what look like a forest and a couple kenku in various outfits
      - There is also what looks to be a hand-whittled flute, or other woodwind instrument
    - one of the maps has a little X marked on it with the inscription "investigate?" written next to it. The X is just on the other side of the closest tunnel through the canyons.
- Once the tunnels through the plates are revealed, if they try entering one they won't find much. Just a narrow, unlit tunnel that winds a bit (which bowstring didn't bother to mark on the map), before reaching the other side. Immog's heartbeat is very noticeable, not loud but noticeable, in the deepest parts of the tunnel. They'll notice that the sound is indeed rythmic, recurring at precise intervals corresponding to about 15 seconds
- If they explore the canyons a bit more, they'll stumble on the gazer stronghold
  - Specifically, as they walk they'll notice a cavern that appears to be emitting a glowing orange-red light that stays steady, not flickering like the candle flame


- the party leaves a note in the northern hideout that says "Hi, Whistle was here (with friends). We're in town in Hope's Rock, I'd be happy if you could come by for a chat."
- party also leaves a note in the entrance tunnel to the Spectator stronghold telling bowstring that they were there and killed the spectators
