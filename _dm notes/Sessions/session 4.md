# session 4

- Open with the party still in the cave, just finished off the dust mephits
- If asked, Rorvun gives them their first solid lead on Bowstring: the exact location of one of her hidey-holes
  - yes, one of. He has reason to believe she has at least one other
    - [insert really obvious logic that Rorvun thinks he's a genius for figuring out]
  - As soon as Whistle says something like "I'm looking for this kenku/my sibling," Rorvun immediately makes the connection and says "Oh, you're Bowstring's sibling?"
  - Rorvun met Bowstring when he was investigating what looked to be a small monster den, but was actually Bowstring's hideout. An arrow came out of nowhere and pinned Rorvun's cloak to the rock wall
  - Rorvun offers to mark the locations of the two of Bowstring's hidey-holes he knows on a map...which none of them own as yet
- Party (presumably) heads back to town with the injured Rorvun
  - They can follow the tracks that led them to the cavern, as none of them have a map
- Siril intercepts them just as they enter the town, welcoming his fellow dragonslayers, and offering to buy them a drink 
  - Rorvun tells him to fuck off
- Drop Rorvun off at the house where the priests of Ebor live a medium-sized cavern on demon's lane, not too far from the shaggy alligator
  - If they accept his invitation inside, they'll meet Steel Crash and Ormen
    - Steel Crash gives the group a wave as they enter, but doesn't get up to greet them (is oiling a shortsword)
    - Ormen is in full armor, having just finished training with Steel Crash outside the city
      - Casts a higher level healing spell on Rorvun, fully healing his leg
      - Thanks the group for helping Rorvun, though he isn't really able to give them a reward beyond offering training
      - Does offer that they can use the place as at least a temporary home, as there are a couple spare cots in the back
      - He does inquire if the party would be willing to help out the priests: he's not asking them to convert, merely offering to pay, in housing and possibly gold/materials/weapons, for any information they have that might help him find the remains of Immog in the tomb
- They probably ought to inform Jemar that they found and killed the beast
  - Find the location of his mansion on Beholder's Boulevard. The largest house in town
  - He'll inquire as to what the hell it was, and why it was kidnapping people
  - He'll believe that they dealt with it, especially when they inform him that they brought Rorvun back
    - He isn't usually so trusting of the adventurers in this town, but from the dinner he thinks they're a bit naive and unlikely to lie to him
  - If they brought back the earth spirit's body he'll offer them 800 gold for it
    - If they haggle or say "well we were thinking of keeping it as a trophy" he'll go as high as 1000, but stop there
