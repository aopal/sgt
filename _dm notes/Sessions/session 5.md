# session 5

- If they get a map and meet back up with Rorvun to find out where Bowstring's hideouts are, they'll get the two map markers revealed. They may just barely have time to reach the close one, though they'd likely have to plan to spend the night there if they go today vs. the next morning
  - On the path to whichever one they go to, they will hear some howling & barking ahead of them. As they approach, they'll find a small pack of 4 direwolves
    - next to the hounds is the corpse of a rhinoceros (need a survival/nature roll to figure that out), as well as one dead wolf 
    - the survivors are somewhat wounded, all at 5-10 below max HP
  - Whichever one they go to, they'll need an investigation or perception roll DC 13 to find the entrance, as they are both hidden with a grid of sticks covered in moss, likely to hide from both monsters and other adventurers
  - Inside is a small cave around 12-15 feet in diameter, small enough to be lit from the outside light
    - There's a bedroll on the ground, some rocks arranged in what looks to be a desk and stool, two daggers, a bow and a quiver.
    - There's a small box containing some dried rations and waterskins
    - The desk rock has a few pieces of parchment on it, which seem to be maps of the canyon network, at a much higher resolution than the map they have, likely drawn from exploring the canyons on foot
      - If they try to compare these maps with their map, they'll notice some lines in a different colour than the rest, that don't exist on their map
      - There are some doodles on the edges of the maps, including what look like a forest and a couple kenku in various outfits
      - There is also what looks to be a hand-whittled flute, or other woodwind instrument
- Once the tunnels through the plates are revealed, if they try entering one they won't find much. Just a narrow, unlit tunnel that winds a bit (which bowstring didn't bother to mark on the map), before reaching the other side. Immog's heartbeat is very noticeable, not loud but noticeable, in the deepest parts of the tunnel. They'll notice that the sound is indeed rythmic, recurring at precise intervals corresponding to about 15 seconds
- If they explore the canyons a bit more, they'll stumble on the gazer stronghold
- If they head back to town, there are a couple things they can do
  - Find Siril in the Giant's Burrow, he'll buy them a drink and explain what the Shattered Cult is all about
    - The core of their beliefs is to find value in everything, no matter how small or broken it is. Everyone and everything can be fixed through hard work and devotion, though that repairing may be slow.
      - Siril's speech: "Well, I've never been much of one for sermons, ironic as that may seem. I'm a scholar by trade, they tend to be more lecture style. In any case, let me start off with a question first: since you've arrived here, have you noticed a sort of...thumping sound every now and then?" [answers of yes, presumably] "A lot of people have theories of what that sound is, one adventurer who, uh, passed through this town, as it were, claimed it was the hammering of the great forge of...some other long dead god, I didn't bother to remember its name. To me, that thumping sounds like a heart beat. And the thing is, I've studied magic, and I've studied history, and it takes a lot of power to kill a god, and they can survive much more than a mortal can. Now people have done it in the past, great heroes have managed it. But to kill a god of war, not a god of flowers or what have you, that my friends, would truly be a feat. And thus my conclusion that Immog must be alive, likely reduced and in a dormant state, but somewhere in these canyons."
      - speech, cont: "As for what we teach, well its a simple philosophy really. The god is broken, shattered into a thousand thousand pieces, but he still lives, and he still has power. This teaches us to seek the value in broken things, as all mortal things are flawed. As we help our god heal and resume his rightful place in the pantheon, so to do we repair ourselves, and achieve our rightful place at his side."
      - regarding Rorvun's accusation of them being a death cult "I do want to put your mind at ease about the death cult business Rorvun was shouting about, he means well, wonderful fellow. The old priesthood of Immog, back before the shattering, did involve certain sacrifial ceremonies. I mean, god of war, that kind of involves a lot of blood. But I do rather think that now, being intimately aware of what his own blood being spilled feels like, I do rather think that would change his tune once we resurrect him."
      - Some note that a lot of this seems like rephrasings of the teachings of the beggar king
      - Siril might mention Vorqull, the farmers, and the miners as examples of who the shattered cult is for. Vorqull is a member, though also sympathetic to the priests of Ebor
      - In fact, he'll call Vorqull over, and introduce her
      - Vorqull will make a brief and gruff confirmation that "I mean, nobody ever really cares about labourers, do they? I've never been a religious sort of person before, but if someone out there - well not just someone, a god - is willing to fight for me, well favours for favours as they say. I owe him some thanks, now don't I?"
        - If they ask her about what being trapped in the tomb is like, she'll laugh and do the "Have any of you ever been in a real prison?" bit
    - If they ask some tougher questions, he'll admit, in a low voice, that he's never one for worship of the gods, he mostly just joined because he thought they were the group most likely to figure out the secrets of the tomb
      - He'll try to disguise his interest in power as a scholarly interest in the magical phenomena of the tomb
  - If they bring the enchanted sword to the town blacksmith he recognizes it as craftsmanship from the Mikhesal empire. "Expertly balanced, light as a feather and barely ever needs sharpening from the enchantments on it. By the engraving on the tang, this was the weapon of a rank-and-file corporal, second in command to a squadron of less than a dozen soldiers in the Mikhesal army. By your standards, the person who wielded this sword could hardly fight worth half a damn."
    - Sword is a +1 shortsword dealing 1d6+1 slashing damage + 1d6 radiant damage. 
  - Ask around about a wizard who can help them identify the items they've found
    - Siril will be mentioned, as well as Fragile Riddle, the tabaxi wizard
    - If they ask the blacksmith, he'll explicitly recommend Riddle as being fairly priced, mentioning that their magic helped build the forge
      - If they ask around about Riddle, they'll find them relaxing on a bench in the town square with a mug of tea, along with Daerlin who's painting the vidrite walls
      - Riddle, specializing in earth magic, is immediately able to identify the elemental gem as containing an earth spirit, and is able to confirm the blacksmith's assumption about Immog's blessing on the shortsword they found
      - While chatting Riddle and Daerlin will mention the Artist's Guild, and explain that quite a few non-adventurers come to Hope's rock entirely for the scenery, only venturing outside its walls with guards. On the topic of people who actually like living here, Vorqull will be mentioned in passing
        - Daerlin will make a snide comment about some people being able to make the lift fee the price of a vacation. Riddle will admit to some uneasiness about the scheme
      - Riddle will mention her standing offer to all denizens of the tomb, to pay handsomely for any sample of vidrite that can be prised from the walls of the tomb
  - Start working on that pet shop idea?
    - They can start asking around for ideas I guess
