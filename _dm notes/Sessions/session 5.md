# session 5

- If they get a map and meet back up with Rorvun to find out where Bowstring's hideouts are, they'll get the two map markers revealed. They may just barely have time to reach the close one, though they'd likely have to plan to spend the night there if they go today vs. the next morning
  - If they bring the enchanted sword to the town blacksmith he recognizes it as craftsmanship from the Mikhesal empire. "Expertly balanced, light as a feather and barely ever needs sharpening from the enchantments on it. By the engraving on the tang, this was the weapon of a rank-and-file corporal, second in command to a squadron of less than a dozen soldiers in the Mikhesal army. By your standards, the person who wielded this sword could hardly fight worth half a damn."
    - Sword is a +1 shortsword dealing 1d6+1 slashing damage + 1d6 radiant damage. 
  - Ask around about a wizard who can help them identify the items they've found
    - Siril will be mentioned, as well as Fragile Riddle, the tabaxi wizard
    - If they ask the blacksmith, he'll explicitly recommend Riddle as being fairly priced, mentioning that their magic helped build the forge
      - If they ask around about Riddle, they'll find them relaxing on a bench in the town square with a mug of tea, along with Daerlin who's painting the vidrite walls
      - Riddle, specializing in earth magic, is immediately able to identify the elemental gem as containing an earth spirit, and is able to confirm the blacksmith's assumption about Immog's blessing on the shortsword they found
      - While chatting Riddle and Daerlin will mention the Artist's Guild, and explain that quite a few non-adventurers come to Hope's rock entirely for the scenery, only venturing outside its walls with guards. On the topic of people who actually like living here, Vorqull will be mentioned in passing
        - Daerlin will make a snide comment about some people being able to make the lift fee the price of a vacation. Riddle will admit to some uneasiness about the scheme
      - Riddle will mention her standing offer to all denizens of the tomb, to pay handsomely for any sample of vidrite that can be prised from the walls of the tomb
  - Start working on that pet shop idea?
    - They can start asking around for ideas I guess
