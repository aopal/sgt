# session 25

- at a bird's eye view, this party is meant to bring a lot of plotlines together, and reveal some information that shouldn't be hidden anymore (mostly the identity of the 4 gods using the party as pawns)
- in rough terms we've got 3 plotlines: The election, the new town, and the main plot about Immog being dead or not in the center of the canyon.
  - Most of the partygoers will be focused on the first 2, and the people who care about the 3rd like it that way. Most people are talking about small scale power, while these representatives of the gods are worrying about the literal power of a god, just lying there

## The masquerade session (part 1?)

### Preparations/daytime

- open on the morning of the party, doors open at the Margrave at 7:00
- the party presumably needs to procure masks (and mauybe costumes) from somewhere, both for themselves and their two guests (Kilo and Gell)
  - They also need to get Kilo and Gell into the town, though they have a way of contacting them
  - Gell can use illusion magic to disguise himself and up to 2 others

### The party itself/evening
- party starts at 7. It's a masquerade, illusion magics are outright encouraged. Everyone at the party will be referred to by the codename on their invitation, and will be in some form of disguise
  - Weapons will be allowed in. The reasoning being a spellcaster can probably do more damage than a greataxe, and it's extremely easy to hide a wand or a crystal
  - kind of base the party on the secret fraternity party from Lavender Jack season 2
- Bouncers at the door checking invitations and letting people know the rules of the night. Notably, what happens here stays here. The party will also get some pins that will be their nametags for the night: they'll read "The Fighter", "The Bard" and "The Rogue", and the pins for Kilo and Gell will read "Ambassador"
- Lady Azure (codename: The Illustrious Hostess) will greet the party as they enter, glad that they've come
- There's a bar where drinks and food are being served (open bar), a dance floor, and some live music provided by some bards
- Depending on when they arrive, other people may or may not be there
  - They'll be able to identify people by either a perception or an insight check. Some of these people will not be hard to spot (e.g. Ormen, fragile riddle)
  - People they know that will be in attendance:
    - Ormen
    - Steve
    - Azure
    - Laslow (proprietor of the shaggy alligator)
    - Fragile Riddle
    - Daerlin
    - Yesri
    - Bari
    - Zatari
    - Walton (the knight they heckled like 10 sessions ago)
    - Manny Barkeep (not in disguise)
    - Several miners/town guard they'd know working the event (not in disguise)
  - Other notable attendees:
    - The death cleric of Achiel
    - The druid of Ilin
    - Several high-ranking members of the merchants of adventure that the party doesn't know yet

### stuff that can happen during the party
- miscellaneous, non-plot stuff
  - Party gets into a fight with someone, the onlooker s will not step in and intervene
  - Dance with people
  - Drinking contests
  - Join the musicians for a number
  - Join circles of adventurers boasting about their accomplishments (this is where they'll find Walton)
  - Join the poker game
- Talk to Manny, who'll be behind the bar running the show for tonight, and will say something along the lines of "Huh, so you three got an invitation...not sure how I feel about that"
  - He'll make it clear that tonight is about the elite planning the future of this town, and if they didn't invite someone then they think that person doesn't or shouldn't get a say. He only got an invite and mask since he's one of the candidates for the election
  - He'll want to hear from the party which side they're on
  - All the staff working the party will not be in disguise or masks, despite the repeated mentions that everyone is faceless tonight. The reading of the two facts is maybe slightly obvious: either it's the upper class saying that the working class are all nobodies, or they're saying they're already faceless by virtue of being lower class, or both.
- At some point Azure will come find them, and re-introduce them to their sponsor
  - She'll thank them for all they've done for him, letting slip that he intends to be the replacement candidate for Jemar, and he sure intends to win. She'll mention that he's already paid off the lift debts for the party and considers their business done for now, but only if the party wants to. If they want to help him win he won't say know, viewing the party as one part espionage and one part muscle
  - She won't outright say she plans to fight dirty to win, but that's what she intends to do
- listen in/join in on various conversations between people they don't really know
  - people talking about vidrite, since Alston's been mentioning it, and word spreads fast in a small town. A lot of people want some
  - talking about the election, who the merchants of adventure are likely to support, and who's likely to win
    - more specifically on the who's likely to win front. Given that this is a party for the upper echelons of the town, the conversation will only be about 3 of the 4 candidates: The party's sponsor has the bonus of being a seasoned politician, Bari seems a decent choice as the candidate most obviously capable of defending against threats of either monsters or other nations, with Daerlin being a slightly distant third option, but some people vibing with their dreams of a town built off of ideals and art, not just pure commerce
    - Manny barkeep is very definitively the lowest in the running out of this crowd, given his very explicit position as a working class candidate, but the party will note that there's only maybe 50 people at this party out of 250-300 in the town.
  - Arguments about what's gonna happen with the lift if the merchants of adventure lose control of the town due to the election. The aristocrats take the side of leaving the price in place, as it's reasonable enough for them, while average adventurers will still see it as pretty steep, and should be abolished
  - Talking about the other town, mostly wondering how those people got there, how they're surviving, and what relationship should exist between the towns
  - Some of these topics in combination: there will be threads of heavily whispered conversation about taking vidrite and making it the main export of a new duchy. What no one outside the town knows is that the canyons are actually a fantastic place to start a city state or duchy: food grows so fast without ever depleting the soil, the canyons are so deep that plenty of raw ores are easily accessible, and they've got a monopoly on vidrite, a substance that they could make unmatched weapons out of in potentially huge supply
- the 4 representatives of the 4 gods that are messing with the party will spend most of the night in conversation together: to outside observers debating theology, but are in fact making veiled threats to each other to stay out of their gods' plans in the canyons, and trying to trick each other into spilling the beans on what those plans may be
  - Titles will be the paladin (ormen), the priest (steve, no one knows he's a warlock yet), the cleric (of Achiel) and the druid (of Ilin)
  - The main point of discussion is what's now an open fact among the learned in Hope's Rock: that Immog isn't dead. No one knows where he is in the canyons yet, but he's weak enough to either have his power stripped from him by a would-be new god, or else to be killed outright by a rival in the pantheon
  - None of them will be able to identify Ormen as what he really is, though he'll be able to tell which gods the other 3 are representing pretty easily (if the party asks him)
  - If the party asks Ormen why the fuck he brought Steve here when the plan was to keep him isolated from the town, Ormen will say it's bait. He's waiting for Steve to make a wrong move and out himself or his plans, whatever they may be
    - His excuse will be Rorvun running his mouth off and mentioning the fall of Immog. With that cat out of the bag, Ormen may as well see how Steve reacts to everything going on in the canyons
  - The druid is from the same place Val is, and will immediately greet them warmly in their own language, saying how nice it is to meet a neighbour. The druid will whisper to them "May ilin guide your footsteps" at some point, maybe using the message cantrip
- Kilo and Gell get into some shennanigans without realizing it
  - Gell gets into a poker game and absolutely sweeps it despite it being the first time he's played, given his ability to read minds. This may turn into a fistfight unless the party can avoid that somehow
  - Gell reveals that Jemar's murderer is at the party
    - Maybe he does this after the party, and says "oh shoot, I couldn't quite tell the masks apart", all they're able to give them is that the murderer is a non-monstrous humanoid (i.e. not a tabaxi or kenku or etc.)
  - Kilo or Gell get unmasked somehow, causes a commotion and potentially distrust between the two towns
  
- If they notice the trap door at the back of the margrave, they might be able to sneak in there and overhear the private meeting going on in the tavern's cellar
  - Hint at this towards the middle of the night by mentioning that they don't see some people they saw earlier in the night (Azure, their sponsor, etc.), requiring a perception check of course
  - In here is where they'll overhear the conversation about turning the town and the canyons into a city state that can compete as a real power on the continents, not just a town
    - Part of this conversation will be a discussion of what to do about the other town in the canyons: do they merge or ally with it and risk their conspiracy losing control over the evolving state over time, or do they strike hard and fast and take whatever resources that town has, and soon

### Poker mechanics

- "low-stakes", "friendly" game with buy-ins in increments of 10 GP
- Mimic texas hold-em but very stripped down for speed, and to use D&D mechanics. Tl;dr: highest sum on a 2d6 roll wins
  - The dealer deals cards to each player, mimicked by a single roll of a d6 for each player
  - There's a round of betting with an ante/minimum bet of 2 SP
  - Once everyone's matched the bet, the dealer reveals the face cards, mimicked by another roll of a d6 (note: separate d6 roll per player)
  - Have another betting round, after which point the players show their cards, i.e. the sum of their 2d6 dice roll
  - highest sum takes the pot, somewhat mimicking the distribution of the ~10 different hands in poker. 
    - If two people have the same sum, the person with the highest value on either dice takes it (e.g. two players both roll a total of 8, one with two 4s, and one with a 5 and a 3. The 5 and 3 takes the whole pot)
- players can also engage in the social side of poker, represented by reading other players with insight checks, or bluffing using some kind of Charisma check. The GM will give information about what a character thinks another player's cards are depending on the result of the checks
- How this works varies between PCs and NPCs
  - PCs: 
    - PCs can roll insight to try and read another player, contested by that NPCs deception. The GM will then tell the player what their character is able to get from their opponent, which may be that t
    - PCs will also generate a passive deception score, which will be used when NPCs try to read a PC to save time
    - PCs can also intentionally roll deception, intimidation or performance to try and bluff an NPC with a specific action
  - NPCs:
    - NPCs can roll insight to read another player, contested by a passive deception. This will not necessarily be done every round of betting
    - NPCs will bluff whenever they want, it's up a player to say when they want to roll insight
  - At any point during the game a player can choose to roll an insight check to try and read another player at the table, contested by a deception check. Depending on the results of the checks, the player will get information from the GM of what their character thinks: either a range of the opposing player's cards might be in, or potentially the exact card(s) the player things that competitor has
