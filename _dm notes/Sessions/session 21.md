plan:
- Party wakes up and finds a note left for them under the door
  - Lady Azure is informing them that the ball she mentioned will be in 3 days time, and she would *very much* like the party to bring a guest or two from the "other town" - after all what better way to start building bonds of friendship than to all drink together and let loose a bit?
    - The letter also includes 5 invitations, explaining the date & location (the margrave), that it will be a masquerade ball (illusions encouraged, truesight will be considered a faux pas), and that the attendees will all be using pseudonyms chosen by the organizers
      - The party will be known as The Bard, The Fighter and The Rogue, and the other two invitations are made out to The Mysterious Guest(s)
      - I would love them to invite the very friendly mindflayer
- party meets fragile riddle early in the morning with the cart, plan being to head to the place where the meteor fell and pick up the rest of the shards
  - Along the way she'll ask the party some questions about the vidrite, and ask them to do a couple more experiments. She'll mention having already tried a few things, such as acid and fire
    - She'll first have them try cutting rocks and stuff, which will get sliced through with ease
      - She'll have procured a bunch of materials of varying hardness (not a diamond though)
    - She'll request that one of them try swallowing a (small) shard
      - if they go through with it, they'll receive some visions of Immog in a future session. The shard will actually vanish - not get digested, but vanish
    - She'll request that one of them try giving themselves a shallow cut with a shard
      - If they actually do it it won't do anything special, it'll just feel weirdly cold and send a jolt up them, as if they hit a funny bone (it's slicing into their soul, but only just a little bit)
      - The blood it touches will seem to get absorbed into the vidrite (passive perception dc 15 to notice this, or active perception dc 10)
      - this blood makes the vidrite more powerful: stronger, sharper, more resistant
    - She'll suggest they try cutting some crops with some shards when they get back to town, or else see what happens if they put some shards next to a seed as it's planted
    - 
  - When they find the site it won't have been disturbed, and they'll be able to *carefully* load everything up
    - At this point Fragile riddle will suggest trying to see what happens if they push a shard into a wall
    - Assuming the party does this, this will open a portal (using the same animation they saw earlier happening naturally) to the non-euclidean dungeon    
- if/when they get back to town, we might be able to do the bit where Siril jumps them
  - Another thing that could happen: People just generally want to get their hands on the vidrite. On the way back to town Fragile Riddle will talk excitedly about sharing her research on the stuff as soon as she can, talking about how powerful it must be and what strange properties it must have




- misc notes:
  - party opens a couple portals to random places in a cave, and gets ~1 litre of liquid god blood
  - gave blacksmith a bunch (~dozen?) of golfball pieces of vidrite to make arrows and a dagger for them, as well as the meteorite to see what he can do with it
    - Party allows the blacksmith to do whatever he wants with the remainders, so long as they get a cut
  - Party generally trying to keep the vidrite on the down-low, especially the liquid stuff and the whole opening portal things
  - Do something with the party's sponsor
    - They'll write him a letter
  - Party tells Ormen about the solid vidrite, but specifically not the liquid stuff, and gives Ormen some of the solid pieces
    - Also tells them about the ability to make caves, and that fragile riddle knows
    - Ormen asks to be there if/when they open a portal in the town itself
  - Store all the smaller pieces of vidrite in some crates and barrels
    - Leave the bigger pieces at Bowstring's hideout, with a note explaining what it is and why it's there
  - Try cutting a wooden wall in the mayor's house, nothing much happens
  - Try cutting a hole in the floor of the canyon with vidrite
    - Open a portal to the underside of a cave, with a very long drop down through it
      - hole is 5 feet wide, and opens to the ceiling of a very large cave
    - Write on the wall nearby "Danger: giant hole, you will mcfuckin die" "No highly esteemed deed is commemorated here", make a little fence with some posts & rope, and also put a note on the town notice board about it
