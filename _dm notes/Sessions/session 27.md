(start of a new arc?)


- open on the party investigating the wake of the balhannoth's appearance
- questioning the sketchy magical people they know
  - Sho:
    - Will mostly ignore their questions and pose her own/ramble on about her own stuff. Appears to almost regret the death of the Balhannoth, calling it a "fine beast". Will vaguely hint that she knows who did it, though she obviously won't say it outright
  - Jean-Paul:
    - Will be noticeably distraught, lamenting the guards who were injured and killed. Will not have any further information, monsters and combat magic are not his expertise
  - Steve:
    - will be evasive - he has yet to admit to the party that he has any magical talent at all
  - Fragile riddle: 
    - Has encountered balhannoths before. Typically extra-planar, and also typically cave dwellers. She'll find it odd that one would wander "out doors", though the combination of night-time, the canyons being fairly enclosed and being summoned likely explains that
  - Ormen:
    - 
- Investigating where the thing came from
  - With daylight/new survival roll they'll be able to track the thing back towards the center of the canyons rather than a cave
- Bari and Manny will be around, sharing a sort of de facto leadership in the cleanup and re-organization efforts
- Bari will question the party herself.
  - She'll mention that the party seems to rather conveniently be involved with a lot of the major goings-on of the town as of late
  - She'll run back last nights events in an accusatory manner:
    - The party showed up to the masquerade with the ambassadors from the other town in tow, a town the party informed Bari was comprised of monsters, but the party swears they're "nice"
    - Later that same night a monster attacks the town, making it through the gate for the first time in years
    - The party is conveniently the first ones on the scene, "heroically" slaying it
    - The monster yells out something about being summoned by someone
- Manny will want to know anything the party finds out, as this attack disproportionately only affected the rank-and-file of the town guard
  - The incident will get Manny thinking about hiring more qualified adventurers for guard shifts, at least 1 on each gate

What actually happened:
- party runs into a bone devil, ends up promising to help make it a portal back to hell
- run into a sphinx, to whom they explain the entire history
  - sphinx casts legend lore about Immog, says "the ancient red dragon still walks this earth, though not in the form one might recognize, neither in shape nor in mind. Those that were once friends may now be foes, and foes might now be friends" 
  - name: Teya?
- Get to the center of the canyons, meet Immog
  - He explains the whole deal with him trying to be better now, and that he's trying to keep people from taking his power, which is just sitting there
  - He's aware of the whole deal with canyons opening up and people being stranded here, but can't do anything about it without risking the other gods noticing and jumping his ass
