- open on the party introducing the mintotaur and Comeau to the priests of Ebor
  - Ormen will show interest partially out of desire to see a peaceful resolution, partly because this could mean the center of the caverns is accessible to him to seek out Immog's remains
  - Steel crash and Rorvun will just go along with this as acolytes
- The party presumably go and talk to Jemar to try and get a settlement to get the monster town access to the lift
  - Ormen will offer to come along and lend his weight to the conversation
  - Jemar and Celine (the noblewoman they met in the posh bar) will be in conversation in his living room
  - Jemar will be surprised to see the minotaur but will try to cover it
    - he will be reserved but open to the idea of a truce or treaty
    - he will ask what the monsters want and what they can offer
  - Celine will try to push for him to accept this, thinking they can be used to destabalize the town just like the worker's revolution
    - She will try to find an opening to give the party a hint to this, with a conspiratorial wink
  - Jemar will agree to provisional talks with the leaders of the monster town, recognizing the minotaur doesn't have the authority to make deals, and himself needing to consult with people
    - Provided the party doesn't manage to royally fuck things up somehow. He won't need that much persuading - he won't want to categorically say no and risk an attack on the town without judging their strength 
- After this they'll probably have some downtime and show the minotaur and Comeau around town, or otherwise ask them to contact their people about next steps
- At this point, or interrupting things if they just shoot the shit, the minotaur will have bad news: 
  - the group he was a part of got back to the monster town, and the idea of a truce has not gone over well with some other factions within the town that don't want knowledge of the town known outside its walls.
  - There is apparently furious debate and accusations flying, but most importantly the leader of one of the factions vehemently arguing for the secrecy stormed out of the debate muttering about "taking matters into his own claws"
    - The minotaur thinks this might mean that he plans to come to the town and assassinate himself and anyone who knows about the monster town
- The minotaur can offer some information about the assassin: 
  - he's a Vrock named Thok, a winged demon who's resistant to many common types of non-magical damage
  - Based on what the drider said of when Thok left, he thinks the party has about 2 hours to prepare before Thok arrived
  - He presumably will be searching for the minotaur specifically

[ fight occurs, Thok is alone unless the party makes some good plans, in which case he'll have 2 imps with him ]

- in the aftermath Jemar will find the party and ask what the hell happened, and why the monster only went for them and not any civilians
  - hopefully they can say something convincing



what actually happened:
- Party introduces Kilo and Matt to Ormen
  - Ormen is receptive, appears enthusiastic to help negotiate a peace treaty between the two towns, offers to help convince Jemar
- The party decides to organize a party to butter up Jemar before introducing him to Kilo and the whole idea of the other town
  - They go to the margrave to buy some fancy wine from Manny Barkeep (that's his name now)
    - Mr. Barkeep also offers to hook Val up with some weed and various other narcotics, if desired
  - Party visits trip and bonds with him a bit, find the good place to scritch on the underside of their neck
  - Party goes to the general store and gets some cloth and wine glasses for the party
- Party starts, Jemar shows up and is confused by the dignitaries
  - Is eventually convinced to at least consider the possibility of forming relations with these people, chats for a bit and leaves
- Kilo breaks the bad news: The other town isn't fully on board with the plan, one demon is enough against it to take matters into his own claws and come hunt down anyone who knows the secret in the surface-dweller town
  - Party plans to try and convince Thok that working with them is in his best interests: They want to kill Jemar and take over the town, at which point they will open up the town to the monster town as well, potentially giving them access to the lift, but manage to hide the fact that they'd rather not let demons out into the world
  - This works somehow (by somehow I mean a pair of nat 20s). Thok gives them a week to take over the town, or at least make significant progress, and then flies off
