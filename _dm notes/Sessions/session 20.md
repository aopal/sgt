# session 20
- pick back up with the party still talking to Lia
  - Given that Immog was a dragon god, she requests the party go talk to the dragons in the Dragon's Den, to ask if they can confirm that it is indeed dragon blood, and what properties it may hold
    - entering the hall, it is basically just an empty rectangle where dragons can curl up to sleep
    - there are 5-7 dragons in here of varying sizes and colours, including a mix of chromatic and metallic, the majority chromatic
    - The "leader" is an ancient iron dragon, who warns the others off intimidating the party, and allows the party to approach
      - This dragon asks why they've come, presumably they explain
      - The leader will confirm that the vidrite is indeed dragon's blood. They will then warn the party that dragon's blood is powerful and dangerous. It is not inherently cursed or unpredictable or any such thing, but it is similar to gold: dangerous because of what people will do to take it from those who already have it
      - They will take a moment to smell the party and say "hmmmm, but you already have dragon's blood on you, much fresher than what you hold. There is still some on your clothes, and your hair, and your weapons. We are not the first dragons you've come across down in these canyons are we?"
        - referencing session 1, and the young red dragon they killed then
        - After only a slight pause they will clarify that they are not angry with the party. They can tell it was a red dragon, they can smell the fire in the blood, 
      - At one point the leader will shape shift into an elf with piercing grey eyes ("staring down at you hurts my neck")
        - Find some way of hinting that they or other dragons might try to wander into Hope's Rock in humanoid form
      - Once the party runs out of questions, they will demand a favour of the party. It is not an aggression, but an assumption taken as fact. "Dragons were not meant to be caged, to be kept in enclosed spaces, but we do not have the ability to fly out of these canyons. They are too narrow, and too tall. I have observed your town, I have seen the device upon the canyon wall that lets one ascend to the world above. In return for the favours I have done you, you *will* find a way to book passage for myself and my bretheren. I do not expect a miracle of you, I would not have survived this long without patience, but even an immortal has their limits"
- If the party tries pushing a piece of vidrite into the canyon wall, opens a portal to ???
  - Maybe do the hezrou encounter? probably
- Use up some more random encounters if they head back to Hope's rock
- If they go to Fragile Riddle She'll be extremely excited that they actually managed to get some (they'll be able to find her in the Shaggy Alligator)
  - She'll beg them to come help her test what they can do out in the canyon, wherein she'll pull out a notebook and start writing notes furiously
    - She'll first have them try cutting rocks and stuff, which will get sliced through with ease
    - She'll request that one of them try swallowing a (small) shard
      - if they go through with it, they'll receive some visions of Immog in a future session. The shard will actually vanish - not get digested, but vanish
    - She'll request that one of them try giving themselves a shallow cut with a shard
      - If they actually do it it won't do anything special, it'll just feel weirdly cold and send a jolt up them, as if they hit a funny bone (it's slicing into their soul, but only just a little bit)
    - Finally, she'll ask that they try inserting a shard into a canyon wall
      - Hopefully they actually do this. If they do, play the sequence of a new portal opening, and the party enters into section 6 of the cube dungeon. Riddle will be extremely curious, and ask the party to clear the dungeon out so she can come back and take notes when it's safe. She'll give a friendly "toodle-oo" before running off, promising that she'd be well and truly indebted to them if they did all this for her
        - might be more fun for their reward to be the ability to ask a (large) favour of her in the future, rather than just giving them cash or magic items
- If the party isn't careful and rumours of what they have get out, Siril will "politely" ask that they sell some to him. If they refuse, he'll try to take some by force
  - he'll jump them in one of the bars, which will let the fight go for 5 rounds before the bar owner will interfere
  - Use the mage statblock for Siril, and 2 thugs



# misc future stuff

- If Siril manages to get wind that the party has pieces of vidrite, he'll attempt to get some from them. If they refuse to hand them over or sell them, he may try to take them by force
- Ormen will similarly want to study the vidrite

- uses for vidrite:
  - if used on a weapon's edge: ???
  - can be used to open up new portal/caves, rather than waiting for one to open
    - pushing a piece of vidrite into the wall of a canyon will open a connection to a location in another universe
      - The location connected to must be underground, or else not exposed to the sky
      - The hole in the canyon wall will always connect to a door, window, or other opening in the location. The location can have other exits to the larger world, but it is much rarer for this to occur
      - The location connected to *can* be influenced by the person. Thinking very hard of a specific location may result in a connection to that place, but it would take a lot of willpower to accomplish this. Having some objects with a physical connection to that place will aid the effort (lower the DC), the stronger the connection the better. A plant grown in the location or an item made from material mined from that location would be an excellent choice, for example
        - person doing this rolls either a wisdom or intelligence check. Beating a DC 15 will result in some influence on how similar the connected location is to what they desired, with higher rolls causing higher similarity, with an exact match possible (DC 30?)
      - The piece of vidrite is not consumed?
        - Maybe it weakens it, so it can only be used in this way a certain number of times?
      - The size of the opening is proportional to the size of the shard used, though not linearly. A 1 inch shard would open up a 5 foot hole, a 2 inch shard a 7 foot hole, a 4 inch shard a 10 foot hole, etc.
        - More accurately, the size of the opening is proportional to how much of the shard is pushed into the canyon wall

- party got 3 treasure chests full of "gold" coins from the cave
  - These were actually glamoured copper pieces. They now have 3 treasure chests each with 40,000 copper pieces in them
