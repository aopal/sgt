# session 3

- open on having just finished off the grick
  - Skip the dust mephit encounter, enough combat has been had especially with the earth spirit still to come
- Eventually find the earth spirit's lair
  - See that page for description
- Spirit is just starting the ritual to entomb Rorvun
  - In a sort of trance, so it didn't hear the thunderclash and can easily be stealthed on (DC 5)
- fight the thing, see [here](../Monsters/earth-spirit.md) for stat block
  - Rewards which can be found strewn about the lair: a bunch of old weapons (swords, axes, spears, bows), slightly spotted with rust. One sword is gleaming brilliantly, polished to a near mirror sheen, with a small gemstone in the pommel and noticeable craftsmanship. With an investigation roll DC 14 they can find 18GP and 40SP strewn about
    - If they bring the sword to the town blacksmith he recognizes it as craftsmanship from the Mikhesal empire. "Expertly balanced, light as a feather and barely ever needs sharpening from the enchantments on it. By the engraving on the tang, this was the weapon of a rank-and-file corporal, second in command to a squadron of less than a dozen soldiers in the Mikhesal army. By your standards, the person who wielded this sword could hardly fight worth half a damn."
    - Sword is a +2 shortsword dealing 1d6+2 slashing damage + 1d6 radiant damage. 
- Free Rorvun, none of the other prisoners are rescueable
  - Rorvun introduces himself as a Caesalan bounty hunter extraodinaire, having single handedly defeated and captured the notorious Diamond Bulls gang. "Got any debtors you need hunted down, or any kneecaps you need broken, Rorvun's your man." As an afterthought he mentions "oh, well I'm currently an acolyte of the priests of Ebor here in Hope's Rock. Almost forgot about that bit"
    - Hopefully Carter takes the bait and asks about Bowstring
