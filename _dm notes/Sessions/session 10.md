- open on the party in the shaggy alligator, having just spent a while convincing a few adventurers that reforms are necessary
- When they'll leave they'll pass by Jemar and his Butler Jeeves on their way in. Jemar will give them a wave and mention it's the 10th anniversary of Jeeves' tenure as butler "So I think he deserves a looooong afternoon of getting wined and dined by his old friend Jemar"
  - dear god, I hope they take that bait
- various things the party can do
  - Shopping, the artificer's magic item shop is open now in the warehouse
  - talk to the mayor, ask him nicely to improve worker's conditions
    - This won't go anywhere, he'll try to play it off as the party joking, but if they press the issue he'll definitely think worse of them
  - visit the warrens, see what the people there have to say
    - Meet a few servants/bar servers/general working class. All of them would love better conditions, the tomb is pretty much an ancap free-for-all, but don't really believe they have much of a shot of getting it
    - Meet one particular teenager, a halfling named Danric, who is willing to help.
      - Danric is very gaunt, unknown to him he's been invested by the power of the Beggar God, who is also unaware of all the other gods meddling in the tomb
  - get into the margrave, gauge what the upper class's attitude is
    - Have to get past Wurash to get in. He's wearing a set of glasses with blackened lenses, and has a curly piece of twine going from one ear down under his collar
      - He read about this aesthetic "in one of those books where there's no magic, but a lot of technology involved. It's a new genre, none of you would have heard of it"
    - Probably meet Yesri or Walton here, neither of them really give a shit beyond feigning mild interest
    - A bunch of other nobles who basically won't say anything to them
  - Chat up the adventurers and anyone else they know that might be sympathetic
    - Daerlin's probably the only one who is actually interested, though he's still upper-ish class and doesn't fully understand why things are so bad. Everyone else just politely tries to worm their way out of things, or just has a "if they want more stuff pick up a sword and kill some monsters" attitude
  - Sell non-magical armor to the blacksmith. He'll pay extra since its identifiably from the shattering
  - Get their magic items identified
    - Alustine, Fragile Riddle, and Siril can all do this. Siril will do it for free, as he's probably trying to work the party into a manipulatable state by now
  - Visit Alustine's (the artificier) shop, look into buying some magic items
    - She'll also pay pretty well (~50% of value) to buy any magic items they don't want or need
  - Look into finding teachers if they want to learn skills and timeskip
  - Snoop around the mayor's place
    - It will be empty. minus Chei, assuming they go in during the very heavily telegraphed window
    - see the main dungeon doc for notes about what happens here
  - ~If they go out exploring the caverns again, they will eventually run into a group of 4(?) bugbears~
    - ~These are clearly intelligent and have relatively well-maintained weapons, and the party will see them sending a fifth member around a corner, reporting back to some other entity~
    - this kinda would need a map, so maybe scratch it for now
  - If the party goes exploring, they will eventually run across a huge 4-foot long egg. The egg is black, and whatever was in it has hatched, with some clawed foot prints leading away from it
    - If the follow, they'll lead to a cave with some small pools of water in it, and a black dragon wyrmling
    - just theatre of the mind it, no lair actions
  - Check up on the triceratops. They're doing fine, the farmer's are working on building a semi-permanent enclosure for them, and they're munching on some hay
    - The farmers will ask if the party knows what they eat, as they've just been giving it horse feed for now
  - Talk to the Priests of Ebor, particularly Ormen, about the worker's issues
    - Rorvun and Steel Crash are gung-ho to help, Ormen will say he needs to think about at "for while I empathize, we did come here with a much larger mission to carry out"
