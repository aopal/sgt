- open on the party having just knocked out Zatari and woken up Val
  - still day 1 of their 7 days
  - get party to roll a DC 13 Perception check to notice that Zatari has a wand at her belt, marking her as a sorceror
  - if they explicitly and deliberately ask, they'll figure this out anyway
- Presumably go to the cell to drop zatari off
  - Bill will wave them in, saying everything's been quiet. Jeeves and Jemar have clearly tried to communicate but he doesn't think it's been anything significant, or at least he hasn't been able to understand it
    - reminder to the party that Bill speaks ancient Mikhesal, not common (a trader tongue/pidgin of modern Mikhesal and a couple other languages). He's been learning common fast from the farmers and can communicate with the party effectively, though it's slow and frequent mistranslation fumbles, so he probably won't understand everything being spoken between people who are speaking fast
- It's mid-evening, presumably don't do anything tonight
- next morning is presumably their "organize town meeting day"
  - at some point when they're passing through the town square they'll be just in time to notice the lift starting to move down from the top
    - They'll have about an hour before it reaches the bottom
    - it'll be a caravan delivering some supplies. If they party intercepts this at any point the caravaners themselves are the ones transporting the cargo down and into the warehouse. They and one-arm Derik will be pretty relaxed used to the flow by now, they will comment on not seeing Zatari, but it won't raise any alarm bells 
    - That said, one of them will mention this to Derik, who might find this more concerning, enough to (later) grow suspicious and look into it




- need a hook for Siril to insert himself and the shattered cult into the party's plan
  - He'll definitely be on their side, the gamble of being able to upset the status quo and grab power within the town will be worth it too him, much faster to be on the insurrectionist side and claim power than to defend and hope to earn a favour
  - I think I want him to just take charge rather than ask to help (cause the party will say no)
    - lets say they get help from people to put posters up, or do a town crier thing, Siril can find out that way and will rather quickly organize his people to also reach out, but prep people with specific talking points/demands
      - better working conditions, better sharing of wealth
      - Let's lean into the real-world parallels and make him an accelerationist maybe? might be a little too real for an escapist fantasy


what actually happened:
- notice the wand and confiscate it, gag all 3
- stay overnight at jemar's place, find the 50k gold but not touch it
- intercept the lift/weapons shipment, get them delivered to the warehouse and inspect them, they are not sent to the guards
- Siril finds them and mentions that he's talked to some of the workers, primed them to think about what they want to talk about at the meeting (mostly leaning them towards one of them running the town, violent takeover and maintenance of their freedom if they can)
- at the meeting:
  - talk about the town being kinda shit, general agreement, mention the new town but manage to not let slip they're monsters, mention the election and also manage to convince people to go along with it, and specifically that "Jemar will go along with the results"
  - the priests of ebor will notarize the whole process and run it, from accepting nomination slips and counting votes
  - Matt will supervise and make it use ranked ballot because of course does
- after the meeting val asks people not to go adventuring for 3 days so they don't accidentally kill someone from the monster town, one very enthusiastic adventurer agrees
- go on a walk with trip, are able to train him basic riding stuff: left right stop and go


election schedule:
due noon tomorrow (day 3/7): announcement of candidacy
noon on day 4: speeches by candidates on why they want to run
noon on day 5: election








  - at some point when they're passing through the town square they'll be just in time to see/hear a rock being dropped from the top of the cliff, with a little cloth parachute and a message tied to it
    - The message will read something to the effect of
