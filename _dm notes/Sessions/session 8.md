- open in the mine, just before the undead
  - combat presumably occurs
  - none of the party appears to speak mikhesal, so they don't get much out of them unless they happen to have a spell of some sort
  - The wights use cover and tactics, and shout a challenge if the party doesn't stealth on the approach
  - a round or two in the redead knight will burst through a blockade of rubble
    - one of the wights (whichever is closest) will disengage with the party to keep the redead busy
- After presumably vanquishing the undead and getting the loot, 
  - exiting the mine the party will find Siril talking to lazak and a couple of the other miners
  - Siril will make some excuse for not coming in after them (didn't want to get ambushed alone or something), explains he's been talking to Lazak about the miner's plight
  - Steel Crash is not pleased to see him, but is less hostile than Rorvun, and is willing to be polite, if curt
  - Lazak asks if the problem has been dealt with (it has), then asks if the party is willing to at least entertain dealing with the real problem: the conditions of the miners and farmers
  - Presumable yes, Siril will suggest a meeting including the party, Lazak, Torrel, and one of the priests of Ebor
  - Steel Crash is very sympathetic to the plight of the people, but can only tentatively offer her personal support, saying she needs to ask the bishop
    - If she gets a chance to ask Ormen, he will only allow Steel Crash to help organize whatever needs to be organized, he's not willing to lend the weight of his voice and authority since that's not what he's there for
  - Siril says outright that the Shattered Cult is willing to help however they can




WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED
- carter casts comprehend languages, sort of slowly manages to communicate with the wights
- combat still ensues because of a bad persuasion roll, though at the end one of the wights is still standing and cool with the party after joining forces to take down the redead
- party loots the cave, heads back up with the miner's corpse and with the wight in tow
- end on Carter and Siril going to talk to the dead guy, and with Val, Steel crash and Loroghan about to talk to Lazak
