# session 31

- Open after the timeskip of several days
- the election has gone down
  - Winner is: Manny Barkeep
  - Ormen officiated and certified the election result, with no one contending anything
  - In contrast, Steve officially endorsed Daerlin (the artist) who got second last, and has been noticeably huffy about this
  - Manny's top priority is getting the lift running, which he intends to do for free. He'll try and get in contact with the party to have them work out a deal with the monster town
    - Most likely outcome: work with the wild kingdom and have the monsters go there 
- Last session was the calm before the storm. This session should start the ball rolling rapidly towards the final arc
- Ormen will mention to the party that he's come to a decision on what to do about Immog. When the party is ready, the four of them should go to the center of the canyons
  - He intends to talk to Immog and see what he's about (he'll end up trusting him). He'll be undecided what to do about Immog's power between two options: destroying the power somehow, or taking it for himself
  - If the party goes out with Ormen before dealing with the shattered cult, run the Tarrasque encounter
    - Let the party sneak if they really want to (will be difficult as both Ormen and likely Loroghan will be at disadvantage)
    - Foreshadow this a bit by mentioning that they run across some shards of vidrite on the ground, and above they can see what looks to be some claw marks in the vidrite 50 or so feet above the ground
- Mention that people haven't seen anyone from the shattered cult in a few days since the election. The last anyone's seen of them they were hauling a load of a bunch of vidrite weapns back from the blacksmith. The door to their HQ has stayed shut this whole time, though people have reported hearing "strange noises" from within
  - party can try to talk with whichever low ranking member is manning the door, or try to sneak in
  - if the latter:
    - if they manage to stay unnoticed (it's pretty dark inside for the most part) they'll see that the cult has clearly been experimenting with vidrite, as there are some chopped up tables in the mess hall, 
    - map:
      - 6: entrance hall
      - 5: mess/dining hall
      - 4: living quarters
      - 3: bunks
      - 2: Steve's quarters
      - 1: Grand altar



- misc ideas
  - Mention that people haven't seen anyone from the shattered cult in a few days since the election. The last anyone's seen of them they were hauling a load of a bunch of vidrite weapns back from the blacksmith. The door to their HQ has stayed shut this whole time, though people have reported hearing "strange noises" from within
  - do the tarrasque attack
    - Maybe open on revealing who's won the election, followed by Ormen telling the party he's made up his mind on what to do about Immog, and the group heads out into the canyons
    - Maybe Steve notices this? This way they get the implication that he's summoned it (and all the other monsters that have attacked them recently)
      - Could give Steve motive to try a grander summoning by revealing that he openly endorsed one of the candidates that lost in an attempt to get power over the town he could then leverage to try and discover something more about his god/use that power to aid his god somehow
    - This might be too dramatic of an event to jump right out of the gate with - save it for session 2 of this arc or so?
  - I want to reveal Achiel at least somewhat, give them some payoff for that creepy dream and the whole thing about 4 gods messing with them
    - Could have Bowstring show up and be like "Hey bro, so you remember how I just sorta disappeared after having some weird dreams about these here canyons? Well I finally figure out what's going on with that and now I'm freaking the FUCK out."
    - It would be really funny for Bowstring to go "Okay I know this is going to be hard to believe...but what if I told you I met a god. Like a being of such immense power that they can reshape the world to their whim, and I just fucking talked to one like she was a normal person. Fucking offered me a cup of coffee and asked me to sit and chat and shit"
  - There should be one final grand combat encounter, but actually design it well for fucking once
    - Likely a showdown between the shattered cult and the party + whatever allies they have defending Immog's power
  - Hint at the Ormen/Ebor reveal with that jewelry box holding his power again?
    - may not be necessary if I do the Tarrasque thing early
