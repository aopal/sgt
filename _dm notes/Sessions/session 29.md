stuff the party talked about doing:
- investigating the scene of the monster breaking through the gates for more clues
- talking to someone about the fact that Immog is still alive, and might be good now???
  - Ormen and Lia had been the two they'd discussed last session, with Lia seeming like the better pick



- note that the party can start seeing a few people with vidrite weapons as they walk through Hope Rock
- if they talk to Ormen:
  - he'll be noticeably surprised, and will take some convincing to not immediately rush out there and kill Immog
  - He'll definitely consider revealing who he is to them, but the odds of it are low
    - The party might be able to (accidentally) force him to admit this. Asking why he's so confident he can kill a god might make it obvious, or at least raise their suspiscions 
- If they talk to Lia:
  - They'll find her finally freed from the vidrite the previous day, and training herself to walk again
    - She'll note that it feels like a god is laughing at her that she got free of the vidrite, but still can't really go anywhere, but that will change soon
  - Telling her about Immog will immediately send her into a panic
  - After calming down a bit she'll re-explain that she was essentially forced into serving Immog before the shattering
  - Thinking rationally about it will make her grudgingly admit that Immog might actually be telling the truth about being reformed. 
    - The old Immog was known for getting things done by threats and strength alone, from what she remembers hearing from a couple followers of other gods Immog didn't even have the subtlety to scheme amongst the other gods
    - If he merely asked the party to believe him instead of commanding them to do his bidding in someway, he's both probably telling the truth about wanting to do better, and probably is also telling the truth about not having the strength he used to
    - The other option being that the person they met wasn't Immog at all
      - this is a _potential_ idea, that the person they met wasn't actually Immog, but somehow a fakery by Achiel
      - this probably isn't a great idea though. I haven't really set up Achiel well, and at this point this would be a pretty weak 11th hour twist. Immog being a reformed god of war is a much more interesting story beat anyways
- If they go out into the canyons
  - Finally do the viking metal concert? maybe on the way back from their (presumed) visit to Lia, and do the below scene on the way there
  - they run across some other adventurers from town who managed to accidentally plunge a vidrite weapon into the canyon wall and create a portal
    - maybe actually have someone they know in the group this time? 
      - Could put Daerlin in there
      - Having Sho be there might be good drama - the creation of the portal wasn't planned by Achiel, but if he now knows then he's definitely going to use it
    - Sho plus two adventurers they don't know. One of the new guys is from one of the villages outlying Liria who created the portal, thinking of how he wished he was back home with his kids while swinging a vidrite axe at a monster, missing, and clipping the canyon wall instead. Expecting the sword to clang off the wall or bite in slightly, the axe instead swung through the wall with only the amount of resistance that one would expect from water, opening a portal into a cave that fed the stream that ran through his town
    - How this gets introduced: get people to roll perception, and have the first thing they notice be the yelling of children
    - Sho needs to make some kind of ominous comment
      - Ah, my lord loves scenes like this. Such poetry
        - Emphasis on "scenes", might get their wheels spinning about Achiel specifically
  - On their way back (after the metal concert), a monster is tracking them
    - some skill checks to try and get away from it, if they fail then after the fight this one will also say something about a summoner
    - When they get back to town they'll notice Steve chatting with some working class people in the town square, and a number of them are nodding along to whatever he's saying. Steve will noticeably jump a little when he sees them, and try to paper it over as he invites them to listen to his sermon
      - insight check contested by his deception will reveal that he's clearly surprised to see them, seemingly because he didn't expect them to be alive

what actually happened:
- immediately go out into the canyons, run into the man who made a portal
  - convince him to tell people in the outside world about the lift being expensive, and to guard the cave until it closes on its own
  - They escort him back to town and avoid him mentioning opening a cave while there
  - Loroghan has a very ominous conversation with Sho while there
- get to the monster town, tell Lia about Immog being alive
  - She's initially shocked by the news, but grudgingly admits that he may have been telling the truth
  - She mentions that Steve's bad news
- Party spends the night in the monster town, heads back in the morning on trip
  - is tracked by bone devil, ambush and defeat it
- get back to town, run into Steve who's clearly surprised to see them
