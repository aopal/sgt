- Shopping, the artificer's magic item shop is open now in the warehouse
- visit the warrens, see what the people there have to say
  - Meet a few servants/bar servers/general working class. All of them would love better conditions, the tomb is pretty much an ancap free-for-all, but don't really believe they have much of a shot of getting it
  - Meet one particular teenager, a halfling named Danric, who is willing to help.
    - Danric is very gaunt, unknown to him he's been invested by the power of the Beggar God, who is also unaware of all the other gods meddling in the tomb
- Sell non-magical armor to the blacksmith. He'll pay extra since its identifiably from the shattering
- Get their magic items identified
  - Alustine, Fragile Riddle, and Siril can all do this. Siril will do it for free, as he's probably trying to work the party into a manipulatable state by now
- Visit Alustine's (the artificier) shop, look into buying some magic items
  - She'll also pay pretty well (~50% of value) to buy any magic items they don't want or need
- Look into finding teachers if they want to learn skills and timeskip
- If the party goes exploring, they will eventually run across a huge 4-foot long egg. The egg is black, and whatever was in it has hatched, with some clawed foot prints leading away from it
  - If the follow, they'll lead to a cave with some small pools of water in it, and a black dragon wyrmling
  - just theatre of the mind it, no lair actions
- Check up on the triceratops. They're doing fine, the farmer's are working on building a semi-permanent enclosure for them, and they're munching on some hay
  - The farmers will ask if the party knows what they eat, as they've just been giving it horse feed for now
  - Bari may wander by with interest in Trip, and may provide some more information, and swear that unless they want to get rid of them, she won't even dream of cooking them
  - Look into training trip to be a usable mount
- Talk to the Priests of Ebor, particularly Ormen, about the worker's issues
  - Rorvun and Steel Crash are gung-ho to help, Ormen will say he needs to think about at "for while I empathize, we did come here with a much larger mission to carry out"
