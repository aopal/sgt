- open on the party having just convinced a demon not to kill them. They have one week to take over the town or at least make some serious progress (kill a couple important looking people probably)
- It's evening and getting dark (it's after the party), so they head home and head straight to bed
  - On their way a crier will stuff some pamphlets in their hands, which are advertising the artificier's shop
  - Ads mention willingness to buy any and all magic items bought, and selling common and uncommon ones
- That night, all 3 of them have the same dream:
  - they don't see each other, but they're floating in omniscient third person, overlooking a figure standing in a lush garden. The figure is watching a diorama on a table where a bunch of mice are navigating a maze, with various rewards and traps spread throughout. The figure's face is turned down and cast in shadow, and the figure is wearing fine clothes. They'll then start monologuing:
    - (it's Achiel, god of tragedy, but they won't know that)
  - "I've always wondered why ordinary people bother trying to make plans. They don't know anything, they're surrounded by things and events they can never hope to fully understand, why don't they just leave things to those who know what they're doing? I mean, I know I don't know jack shit about fishing for example, so you don't see me going down to the pier and telling the fisherman who've been doing it for generations whether trout are in season or whatever. I don't mess with what they're doing and steal their catch, if you understand the metaphor"
  - At this point their attentions will be drawn to a trio of three mice, meant to represent the party (one black and feathered, one's extremely large and beefy, the third has a dark patch of fur on it's head that looks like a beret). This trio, aiding each other, will manage to scale the walls of the maze and walk along the tops of the walls, looking around. Before they can hop down into any of the rooms with rewards, the figure will gently scoop them up, and petting them softly will continue:
  - "But you see there's a problem with that line of thinking too, because everyone has to start somewhere. Some of those laypeople begin to...stand out, I suppose. They surpass the limitations of most others, they graduate from being big fish in small lakes to being small sharks in a big ocean. [holds the mice up to their face, inspecting them] Now, suppose one of the big sharks were to come across a newly arrived small one, hunting in the big one's territory, disrupting the balance. The big shark would be well within their rights to devour the small one on the spot, no? Recoup some losses before the small shark can cause any more damage. Yet, the small shark clearly shows potential, and the big shark could perhaps use an ally. Both possibilities have an allure. [the figure closes their fist on the mice which vanish, and then they look up at the party, a wide grin showing yet the rest of the face is still covered in darkness] If you were the big shark which would you choose, I wonder?"
- In the morning
  - presumably discuss the dream they had, though maybe one of them will want to conceal it
  - talk to various people and plan things out
  - If they talk to the mayor he'll both ask for any updates they have on the person who robbed him, and about potentially visiting the monster town or a trusted no-man's land to meet with the leadership from there
    - When discussing the theft he'll say "I know I said no rush so really take the time you need, it's just the stress of dealing with that plus now this town things...I like you guys but you give me a real headache sometimes, you know? things were pretty quiet for a while before you lot showed up, I hope you're worth the trouble"
  - They may also run into Siril who'll mention he heard a rumour, he won't say from where, that there is a monster town out in the caverns, and was wondering if the party knew anything about it since they seem to be buddies with Kilo the minotaur
  - Bowstring will also pop in and ask how things are going



- misc things that can happen over the next week:
  - the town wakes up to the corpse of some monster and a chest of gold and magic items, with a note impaled on a horn saying it's a gesture of good faith. Something like "we noticed this bozo prowling around, thought we'd do you a solid before it hurt anyone" without any signature
    - Day 2 or 3? Should help raise tensions a bit, the general populace wouldn't know who this other group is
    - make it a fairly significant monster, but not a dragon again
      - Salamander/fire snake

what actually happened:
- party heads back to town, gathers some people to plan the takeover
  - guests
    - fragile riddle
    - celine
    - Manny Barkeep
    - leader of the miners (forgot his name)(Torrel?)
    - priests of ebor
  - all the guests, somehow, are okay with the plan
    - (plan in discord)
  - Party successfully traps Jemar and Jeeves in the cell, post Chei in the entrance hall as a guard
  - Party leaves a note on his door saying "meetings in progress, do not disturb - Jemar"
  - Forge a letter to Zatari, telling her to meet at Jemar's place in the evening
  - Party gets Bill to guard Jemar and Jeeves, in the room with the cell, tell him not to let them go
    - he will give his 100% for this
  - Get the priests of ebor to make signs saying there's a town meeting
  - Buy some poison to drug Zatari to make it easier to capture her
    - That works, Val falls asleep as well but it works out
  - the priests of ebor are making posters for the town meeting


Some really fun, evil shit I could do for later sessions:
- someone murders Jemar (assuming they manage to lock him up)
  - Would be achiel manipulating someone to fuck things up for the party
