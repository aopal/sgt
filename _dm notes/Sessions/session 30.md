- open on the party back in Hope's Rock, having just talked to Steve
- If they talk to Ormen about Immog
  - When they come in they'll see him hastily shut a small chest on his desk before turning to talk to them
    - this box contains the essence of Ebor's power, much the same way the beating heart on the plinth contains Immog's
  - He'll be extremely surprised, and consider rushing out to the center of the canyons to deal with Immog
  - he'll begrudgingly admit that by his god's teaching's he ought to at least give Immog a chance to prove he's telling the truth
    - "I used to be a violent man and was allowed a chance to reform, I suppose Immog is due the same chance"
  - If they mention that the heart of Immog's power is just sitting there
    - Honestly not sure what he'd do???
    - since they're accidentally a couple steps ahead of both Steve and Sho, maybe having Ormen turn into an antagonist isn't a bad idea
- If they try to find out what the shattered cult is up to
  - they'll find that they have vidrite weapons, and are experimenting to see how they work
  - testing out their effects on dummies, etc.
- Wandering around town will result in them noticing Sho stirring up trouble
  - specifically, they'll hear randos talking about a rumor that if you hit a canyon wall with one of those fancy crystal weapons the blacksmith has been making you can open a portal back home
- If they go out into the canyons
  - do the metal concert encounter
  - If they head to the center of the canyons, make them work for it this time
    - high CR encounter? Maybe do the tracer slimes (slithering tracker)
      - two slithering oozes, and 4 regenerating black puddings all already at half HP
    - a quickling will be trailing them for Sho
