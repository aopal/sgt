ideas 
- make a bulletin board channel to track various sidequests/things happening in the future for the party's sake. includes:
  - oil painting of Trip by Daerlin
  - Saddle being made by Alston the blacksmith
  - Party gets invited to a soiree at the Margrave in a few days time by Lady Azure
    - not to redo a little bit of thievery again, but how about someone in the monster town tells them about a macguffin they need to find, which they then find out is on display at the location of the party, a souvenir from the one of the host's raids into the canyons?
- Center of the canyons get increasingly dangerous, both with monsters and the density of magic/the world gate effect messing with terrain and normal laws of geometry. You can walk in a straight line and end up where you started, gravity may suddenly shift, etc
- Lia: divination wizard/warlock of immog (lvl 10?) who was present at the shattering, foresaw the cataclysm just far enough in advance to protect herself and put herself into statis
  - When she awoke she found her lower body and back encased in vidrite in a sort of stalagmite of the substance on the floor
    - maybe the monster town literally has a bunch of stalagmites/stalactites of the stuff?
    - These could literally by Immog's teeth, that could be fun later
  - eventually met some that could be communicated with, and eventually a subset of those that were willing to work together
  - Knows for certain that Immog is still alive, just weakened, or else her pact magic wouldn't work
  - True neutral, half-elf. Is looking for a way to break the vidrite so she can get free, looking to return to the outside world, very curious what's happened (and how long it's been) since the shattering
  - Will be willing to do a reading for the party, which will result in her saying "...Well you three certainly must lead interesting lives. Now everyone down here has a trace of Immog's influence, but I can sense at least 3 other gods who have messed with your lives"
  - Idea: jaded about the concept of godhood, not a personal fan
- Specific things for next session:
  - Deal with Zatari and Jeeves:
    - They won't be pleased with their capture and the death of Jemar. Jeeves will care more about the latter but doesn't have any power
    - Zatari will absolutely inform the merchants of adventure about the capture resulting in Jemar's death, will leave Hope's Rock for good if the party lets her go. She knows some weird magic thing was involved in Jemar's death which she's fairly sure the party isn't capable of, however she'll still at the very least blame them, if not outright suspect their involvement (maybe it was an accomplice)
  - Ormen will find them and say "I'd very much like to visit this new town the same as you, however I'm currently managing a house that contains a corpse and two prisonser. Would you care to help me out with some of that?"
  - Kilo will approach the party mentioning that Thok wants to talk, but on his turf this time, so they have an excuse to go to the monster town
    - on the way (ormen, matt and Kilo will come along), get attacked by some wyverns as they skirt the center of the canyons. Siril will attempt to join the party but Kilo will forbid it, saying that other visitors have not been allowed as yet
    - Once in the town they'll be brought to a meeting of the leaders of the town, including Lia, Thok, A copper dragon named Toirse (Commonly referred to as Longtail, they/them), and a dryad named Eucalia
      - These 4 will greet them, wanting to provisionally talk about an alliance between the towns
      - Lia will relatively quickly get the other three to leave so she can talk to the party (& ormen) alone, in order to get news on the outside world, and will offer to read their fortunes as a sign of good will
      - Will mention a huge favour if they can give any information leading to her escaping the vidrite
- Residents of the monster town
  - Lia
  - various dragons
  - A very jovial philosopher mindflayer named Gell
    - First person to greet them when they enter?
    - is watering flowers and gives them a cheery wave
  - bugbears & other goblinoids
  - myconids
  - various demons including Thok
  - Fey
  - centaurs
  - a couple other minotaurs
  - 
  - ???


idea: immog was the god of war, and the canyons kind of look like blood vessels. Immog's life force and magic feed the inhabitants of the canyons, and in turn their fighting feeds him. If there's conflict he is sustained, if there is peace he weakens and eventually dies
- show this by the heartbeat growing stronger/weaker depending on how the party shapes events?



Monster town
- one of the canyons gives way to a large cave/undershelf (idk what to call it, basically a clearing but with a ceiling) at a corner where the town has come up
- there are two tunnels that lead to other worlds still open, but guarded and blocked off for now
- in the town square there is a large art installation where people have drawn/painted/carved into the canyon floor maps of where they came from as best as they can remember
