- open on fragile riddle accidentally opening a portal from her house to where the party stays, waking the party up
  - Ormen is understandably a little freaked out by this happening
  - will hopefully give the party the hint that they can (attempt to) control where the portal opens up
- Party heads over to the monster town
  - on the way do the metal concert random encounter
- When there they'll probably attempt to free Lia using a vidrite blade
  - They can try to roll for this, but they'll probably need a specialized tool (vidrite saw/drill/pickaxe)
  - Look for people to bring to the masquerade:
    - Kilo?
    - That one very friendly mindflayer will be suggested
    - A shapeshifted dragon?
    - The centaur barkeep?
- On they way back they'll get intercepted/jumped by Siril & two other cultists (use mage & 2x veteran statblock)

- idea: the party's sponsor is connected to Achiel somehow? or the god intercepts the letters, equivalently


what actually happened
- fragile riddle shows up, party realizes they can influence where portals open to. Val tries to open portal to their home, instead creates one to the dube dungeon, which the party along with Ormen and Riddle go explore
- They run into the deathlock, who's managed to toss on disguise self, call himself "Steve" and passed all his deception checks. Mentions to the party that he's a priest of Immog, and the party agrees to help him leave, once they're done in the dungeon
  - Ormen/Ebor is definitely suspicious of Steve's story, but is willing to run the risk of letting Steve out into the canyons, in the hope that Ormen can use Steve to lead him straight to Immog
