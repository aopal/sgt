## Individual NPCs

- One-arm Derik
	- The affable lift operator who operates the upper end of the lift. Dwarven male, used to be an adventurer but retired after losing his right arm. Warm, friendly and talkative, likes to chat to the adventurers heading down to the Lower Rock.
	- Either isn't fully aware of the lift debts, or is and doesn't feel any remorse for not warning people. LN.
- Bishop Ormen "Big Armor Boi"
	- The Bishop leading the Priests of Ebor in Hope's Rock. NG Male Aasimar Paladin, both eloquent philosopher and theologian, as well as a ruthless pragmatist and warrior. Considered to have slightly radical views on Ebor's teachings, his main focus is the question of the balance between peace keeping, and peace making. Seeks to find if there is any truth to the rumour that Immog yet lives.
	- Unknown to all, including his fellow priests, Ormen is actually the god Ebor incognito. He has left the majority of his power on his plane, and uses high level magic to hides his actually being an Orc. He intends to find the remains of Immog and either acquire any of Immog's power he can, or else destroy the remains if he cannot. He wishes to acquire more power to more directly contend with gods whom he thinks are the enemy of peace. He has spent several decades incognito in his own church, and has come to the conclusion that the non-peacemaking sects are wrong and are not promoting peace, and intents to cleanse said sects from his own clergy once he is done in the Tomb.
- Zatari
	- Female Tiefling rogue. Derik's counterpart in the Lower Rock, guards and operates the waystation at the bottom of the lift. Often the first person adventurers meet after exiting the lift. Likes to dress in extremely fine clothes and jewelry. Known to be a bit eccentric if not erratic, and prone to rapid mood shifts.
	- LE, finds telling people about the lift debt extremely fun. Only a level 3 rogue (arcane trickster) but guards the lift with magic weaponry found in the Catacombs, and locks up the station with a magical lock custom made by a Lirian arch-wizard at the end of the day. Even the other Merchants of Adventure find her unsettling and ruthless, though like the other merchants she will stick to the letter of her word. When displaying or faking emotions she tends to oversell it, often smiling so widely her muscles are visibly twitching in effort.
- Belzin
	- Vrokish halfling owner and proprietor of the Giant's Burrow. Often laughing and fond of stories, both telling her own and hearing those of her customers. If anything, she finds the stories of the lower classes more interesting than the boastings of nobles and adventurers, though she tries to keep her mild disdain under wraps.
- Bari
	- Female Dwarf Barbarian and world-class gourmet chef, originally hailing from Kithcaryn. In Hope's Rock to find rare plants and animals/monsters, with which to make new dishes to amaze the world. Has eaten at least part of every unique monster she's killed, and usually has sampled each different part (meat, eyes, brain, liver, etc.) of each monster. Has accidentally discovered some new poisons this way, currently on the run from Kithcaryn after not realizing one of her favourite new monster parts was poisonous before cooking it for a noble. Occasionally does special menus at the Shaggy Alligator
- Erdan
	- Farashnan elf whose grandfather was present at the shattering and died there. 103, just barely old enough to be considered an adult. Seeks to find a particular enchanted amulet that their grandfather always kept with him, as their family has no other mementos of him. Took on this duty for themself as they're they're the youngest child and the only one without any deeds to their name. Intend to find their grandfather's body or die trying.
- Saelfine
	- CN level 10 half-elf fighter, one of the first adventurers to survive the Catacombs and one of the principal founders of Hope's Rock. Extremely friendly with people who they think have the potential to be worthy adventurers, but has nothing but contempt for the less able. To their view anyone who willingly chooses to come to a place known for extremely dangerous monsters should be ready for it to be a difficult place to live, even if that difficulty is entirely separate from the monsters. In this vein, doesn't see anything particularly wrong with the lift debts, as they think it's a relatively fair price for the cost it took to build the town, both monetary and in blood. Kind of doesn't think about the ethics of only informing people about the debt once they're stuck in the Lower Rock
- Jemar
	- (dge-MAR) Half-orc, founder of the merchants of adventure and self-appointed mayor of Hope's Rock, not that they actually do anything much. Lives in one of the few fully wooden houses, build in a magically excavated cave on his own personal level of the upper street of Demon's Lane. Doesn't stop them complaining about how many steps they have to climb to leave their front door. Only gives the time of day to nobles and adventureres with particularly interesting stories
	- LE, former smuggler/pirate man-at-arms after fighting his way up from a lookout that turned to "legitimate" business in a sort of retirement. Born dirt-poor but took what he wanted
- Torrel
	- wood-elf, overseer of the farmers in Dragon's Gulch. Not inclined to use many words, but seems surprisingly content with her lot as effectively an imprisoned labourer
	- true neutral, formerly a scribe in the courts of the kingdom of Frairus, now an escaped convict guilty of fraud, forgery, and being an accomplice to grand larceny. Came to Hope's Rock because she had no where else to run. Harbors some resentment at her imprisonment on the part of the merchants of adventure, but on the whole finds it vastly preferable to life on the run, as had been her existence for the 5 years before arriving in Hope's rock, about a year before the party did.
- Sirvan
	- (SEAR-vinn) Level 8 male [race] sorceror, Karlsan. Sort of the main recruiter for the Shattered God's Cult, the warm and reasonable face that's meant to draw people in. Hangs around the Giant's burrow to try and recruit newcomers before they can be scared off, as well as any of the poorer citizens of Hope's Rock that are desperate enough
- Yesri
	- Halfling bard, member of the Artist's guild. Tags along with adventurers they find intriguing, as they hope to compose "a new epic for this strange new era, the likes of which the world has never seen before"
- Laslow
	- Uskian human male, owner of the Shaggy Alligator. Never been an adventurer, but was always friends with many hence his branding for the Shaggy Alligator as a place for adventurer. Quick to make anyone who steps over his threshold feel welcome, and equally quick to put a drink in their hand, and remove a coin from their purse. Firm adherent to the teachings of Taesis
- Fragile Riddle
	- Tabaxi Breyzian wizard with a passing interest in architecture and a focus in earth magics. Makes a decent bit of cash carving caves into more home-worthy shapes with magic. Is trying to study Vidrite as, unlike most scholars, they believe that the crystal is magic in some way. Rumoured to have managed to break a piece of the crystal off the walls of the cave.
- Wurash
	- Dragonborn bouncer at the Margrave, Azuran. Rejects anyone that doesn't fit the atmosphere of the place, or just anyone they don't like. Isn't afraid to tell people that last bit, even if they already failed the first criteria.
- Daerlin
	- Dwarven sculptor and painter, member of the Artist's guild. 3rd child of Karlsan nobility, in self-imposed exile and is attempting to make something of himself, as he knows there's nothing for him as a noble who won't inherit. Came to Hope's Rock out of desperation, having heard of it's beauty, and deeply regrets the decision as they have no idea of how he's ever going to leave now. His art has become notably more abstract and chaotic because of this, though if anything his production rate has increased
- ???
	- The high priest of the shattered cult. No one seems to have met them other than other high ranking cultists, and they're not talking. It's unknown exactly who they might be, or if they even truly exist.
- ___ 
	- Goliath, leader of the Lirian agents in Hope's Rock.
	- On the hunt for any and every magical item they can get their hands on, no matter what it takes to do so. Tight-lipped about why Liria is so singularly focused on Mikhesal artifacts. Military purposes, magical research, preventing their misuse by others, rumours and suspiscions abound.
- Todri
	- Gnome, owner of the warehouse store on Beholder's Boulevard. Quiet and direct, doesn't have much on their mind other than their business. Keeps extremely close account of the ledgers
- Alston
	- Human blacksmith and armourer. Extremely interested in pre-shattering Mikhesal weaponry and armor, as they are all very highly crafted.
- Alustine
    - Half-elven artificer, the newest arrival in Hope's rock since the party. Rumour is she's going to set up a shop to sell some common and uncommon magical items, likely in Todri's warehouse. 
- Siril Novake
	- level 5 Lirian tiefling wizard, member of the shattered cult that the party interacts with. Known to be rather intense and blunt, not really mincing his words. Fierce scholar and fighter, he can be found either poring over books or wading through monsters.
	- Not a true believer, but joined the cult just to share any discoveries they make (but not his own) and intends to leave as soon as they've run their usefulness. His goal in life is, simply, to amass as much magical power as he can, until the point of godhood if possible. Is secretely level 10, but hides his real power so people don't consider him a threat.
- Rorvun Cestim
	- Level 5 Caesalan human fighter, adherent to the god Ebor, and serves under Ormen's command. Bounty hunter by trade, came to the tomb out of boredom with his life, and signed onto the priests of Ebor because it fit his own morals
- Steel Crash
	- Level 5 Kenku monk/rogue. Acolyte of the priests of Ebor
- Supatys
	- Dragonborn druid, functions as the town apothecary and healer when needed. Operates out of a stand on Beholder's Boulevard mostly out of demand than any actual desire, as they had originally come to Hope's Rock as an adventurer to study the plants and the spirits of the place
- Danric
    - Halfling teenager, non-combatant. Unemployed living in the warrens. Seems to be able to survive without eating, and is unconcerned by this fact
    - unknown to anyone including him, has been noticed by the Beggar god and infused with his power. The beggar god will manipulate him to be very enthusiastic about any social revolution plans
- Walton
    - Frairan knight-errant; human, loud, boisterous, very condescening in his frequent exclamations of protecting the common folk. Spends much more time in the Margrave than actually doing any of that protection.
    - all of his posturing is mostly a bluff, he's really just concerned with weasling his way into the good graces of the lords
  


People still needed:
- lirian embassy
- more cultists
- more priests of ebor
- more factions?
- nobles - need some more nations first
