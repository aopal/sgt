- have a tarrasque show up because why not, just as they're really losing their shit about it Ormen one-shots it, hinting that he may be more than he seems
- They an attempt to convince Achiel to work with them, which may actually work if they're able to convince him that whatever they want to do will be a better tragedy that his idea
  - e.g. letting the power be destroyed and squandered, this whole centuries-long game being resolved extremely anti-climactically would be very good irony
- During some climactic fight over Immog's power, whoever they're fighting manages to grab it and tries to run away with it. They manage to get outside, and the party catches up just in time to see Trip consume it, taking on its power
- At some point Achiel just beams down, and acts like a frustrated director: changing people's memories and such to get the drama to be what he needs
  - relatedly, could take the angle of Achiel also being less evil than the party expects:
  - Instead of chaotic evil, chaotic neutral. Has definitely orchestrated events that have ended in tragedy because they made for a good story, but is just concerned with making a good story, not specifically tragedy
  - would have to retcon that threatening dream he gave the trio, though that might be doable by just saying that he was frustrated they weren't doing what he expected, and he got over-dramatic
  - would be extremely funny to explain him being less evil than expected by saying that he's been seeing a therapist and had a gradual change of heart over the last few centuries
