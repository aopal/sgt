# Election

general notes:
- Main issues driving debates and the election:
  - Improving the conditions for the working class of the town
  - Defense of the town against future monster attacks
  - The future of the town, particularly around a shift towards a more formal and centralized governing of the town, vs. the somewhat free-for-all nature of the Jemar era
- all 4 candidates intend to address all the major issues, none of them are saying that they aren't issues (where Jemar notably did not care about the working class)

candidates:
- Manny Barkeep
  - Bartender at the Margrave
  - His platform is very explicitly focused on the working class, and making the town someplace livable. He obviously won't make this public, but he intends to cater to the upper class and adventurers only so much as necessary to keep them in line. His history as being a union organizer in another life may come up, which he'll bring up to give himself credibility as someone who's actually capable of organizing people and keeping people fed and in jobs
- Daerlin  
  - Visual artist and third child of nobles
  - Focused most primarily on the future of the town, wanting to turn it into one of the few proper hubs of the world, where all peoples are welcome, and where art and research can flourish.
  - Notably has criticisms of some of Bari's ideas for defense of the town, wanting to look forward to new forms of technology and magic which could keep the town protected without needed people in harms way swinging swords.
- Bari
  - Seasoned adventurer and chef
  - Focused most on defense of the town, as one of the few people left in the town and the only mayoral candidate who was around for a lot of the town's founding, and the early fights to even establish the town. Her main talking point is the fact that while monster attacks seem to have died down, that doesn't mean that they're dying out and won't come back as a storm some day. 
  - She wants to make the town into a well oiled machine that's ready for Tiamat herself to come barrelling down a tunnel
- ____ (the party's sponsor)
  - Aristocrat from Liria
  - Seasoned politician/buerocrat. Tries to sell herself as someone who's well trained and experienced in running cities. Very obviously wants to take the towns unfocused and pseudo-anarchist roots and turn it into a well organized state.
  - Will be very up front about wanting to improve the standards and protections for workers, directly citing the instance of the miners being attacked by undead (while avoiding speaking ill of the dead Jemar). While having flirtations with meritocracy, she does however take the stance of people having a proper place in the state, and will mention wanting some sort of police force, and will casually deride the idea of public education while somehow also praising upward mobility.
