D&D “random” encounter ideas

1. pass by a tunnel with flashing coloured lights coming out of it, alongside the sounds of a concert (specifically viking metal) - guitar, lots of percussion and bass, people shouting
   - band names: Borknagar, Myrkgrav, and Kampfar
   - tunnel leads to a literal underground concert venue
   - when/if they go inside people will be very impressed with their “costumes” (this is a portal to earth)
   - can get drinks, buy t-shirts & cds (& cassette tapes), someone will probably offer to sell them weed at some point
   - between sets one of the bands playing will notice them and invite them to chill in the green room
   - will then get invited to play on stage if any of them are musically inclined
   - Matt will be very curious to hear about this if they mention it to him later


past stuff/ideas

1. pair of hungover travelling salespeople who’ve set up a stall next to a tunnel in the canyons
   - shop name: Audrey’s cut-price magic items boutique. Items will be sold for 1% (?) of their GP value, and given that the shopkeepers are hungover, bartering will be easy
   - selling some magic items: 1 common, 2 uncommon, 1 rare
     - ring of jumping, 15 GP
       - https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/om.php?vo=ring-of-jumping 
     - ragged bag of holding, 25 GP
       - functions as a normal bag of holding, but has been repaired, burnt, stained, etc. more times than one could count
       - https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/om.php?vo=bag-of-holding 
     - brooch of number numbing, 20 GP
       - http://www.thievesguild.cc/magic-items/magic-item?itemid=100 
     - Giant slayer longbow - 35 GP
       - +1 magic weapon, deals an extra 1d6 damage to creatures for every size above medium of the target (+1d6 against large, +2d6 against huge, +3d6 against gargantuan)
     - cape of comfort, 16 GP
       - http://www.thievesguild.cc/magic-items/magic-item?itemid=12 
       - always maintains the wearer at the perfect temperature and humidity within average climates/environments. if slept in or on, lets the wearer comfortably sleep on any terrain, no matter how hard or spiky. If slept in for at least 6 hours, heals the inhabitant for a number of hit points equal to their level
   - intro: one of them notices the party, shouts out asking if they’ll buy something in a language they don’t understand (speak in french), then adjusts a device on a necklace and starts talking in common
   - tunnel leads to the room they rented in the inn they were staying in the night be
   - does not believe a word the party says about them being transported to another world
   - partially cause their hangover is so bad they barely ever keep their eyes open
   - one of them is lounging in a lawn chair with a winchester rifle which they’ve used to shoot a couple giant scorpions a few dozen metres away while whistling
   - the other is hunched over in the stall itself barely awake
3. The party lucks out enough to be around just as a new tunnel connects to another world
need to decide what the effect for this looks like
   - v1 idea: a thin slit opens vertically on the wall and gradually widens, with the rock in the middle appearing to fall in, like sand falling into a hole appearing underneath. as it opens they see veins of red light that appear to move back and forth while pulsing. Finally there’s a flash of light and the distant/muted sound of a roar, before things settle down and just look like a tunnel into the rock
   - they will have to pay for this information by fighting something that comes out of that tunnel
     - Hezrou
4. “Godzilla Vs. Mothra” -  come across two very large monsters fighting each other
    - roc vs. a spinosaurus
11. Find the wreck of a ~12 foot tall mech suit that has a bunch of damage from what will appear to be large talons or claws
   - the party will be able to salvage a lot of materials, including some tech that they won’t know what to do with
   - if they take any of the metal from the armor plating it will be very good for making armor/weapons (some plates/rods/scrap will be strewn around the site)
     - +N wepons? some sort of magical effect?
   - the mech does have a very large sword on one arm. if they take it (presumably Lorohan) will count as a +1 magical greatsword with 10 reach that crits on a 19 or 20 due to it’s special alloy’s strength
   - writing on the mech:
     - 10-AVE
   - There’s a dead pilot inside the mech, some sort of species with fur and 4 arms
12. If the party spends the night somewhere in the canyons, unless they pass a very high (DC 20?) perception check they’ll wake up to find all their money gone, with the bags filled with a mixture of acorns and other nuts
   - with some perception/investigation/survival (tracking) checks they’ll be able to trace a trail of dropped coins to another cave a few hundred feet down the canyon wall
   - if they enter they’ll arrive at a forest glade completely covered on all sidesby tree branches where they’ll find a satyr scolding a collection of small animals (squirrels, mice, magpies, garter snakes) who have coins in various paws/mouths/beaks
   - the satyr will be very apologetic once he notices the party, though the crowd of animals will all raise their hackles while hissing/growling/etc.
   - as an apology he will offer them some ____, and may offer whistle an enchanted panflute that grant him a +2 to performance checks
13. Cave from which golden light appears to be spilling, along with a smattering of coins & fine wares that have spilled out of the entrance
   - inside the cave will be various artifacts, almost all of them cursed but with relatively minor curses (the gold is cursed to just turn into dirt if it leaves the cave, for example)
   - things in the cave:
     - golden lamp. It won’t appear to do anything when rubbed, or anything else done to it, but if the party takes it, the person who keeps it will get 3 wishes granted whenever they ask/wish for something to happen
     - a fine persian rug just before the lamp - which is not a flying carpet but a rug of smothering https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rug%20of%20Smothering#content 
     - boots of dwarvenkind - very heavy boots that grant disadvantage on stealth checks
     - ring of minor invisibility - when worn, the ring becomes invisible
     - Vampire armor - regular chain shirt but isn't visible in mirrors/reflections. Accelrates sunburns
     - An endless mug that also is always leaking
       - Says "World's okayest cat dad" in another language
 - Take 3 treasure chests worth of coins/other stuff
8. A meteor falls from the sky and happens to fall into the canyons, exploding on the ground in front of the party
   - if they get close to the crater they’ll be able to easily figure out what part is the core, as it’ll have caused a lot of condensation still being over a hundred degrees below freezing
   - Maybe it impacts the wall of the canyon, shattering some of the vidrite and raining that down as well?
   - having this happen in the middle of a combat encounter could be very fun (maybe it lands on whatever they’re fighting)
5. something that hasn’t happened the whole time they’ve been in the canyons yet: it’ll rain
   - this is unfortunately rather dangerous as the rain that hits the plateaus between the canyons will fall in, resulting in a large volume of water, causing a relatively shallow flash-flood
   - party will presumably think of running to a nearby cave to hopefully find something with some elevation
   - keep the canyons mildly flooded for a bit after this? could lead to some fun combat encounters with river sharks or something (or more light-hearted ones with dolphins e.g.)
11.  Come across a caravan of very small humanoids - like 1 inch tall
    - As they’re walking they hear a shout of “halt! Don’t come any closer!” in a very high-pitched voice
    - With a perception check (DC 13) they’ll see a group of very small humanoids on the ground, a few who are very timidly pointing spears at them
    - The caravan is gearing up for a dangerous river crossing - of a stream barely a foot wide
    - They give them something if the party helps them cross? Maybe just a (very) small token of their appreciation, like one of their weapons or something
      - they get a spear that does 1d4-3 piercing damage but auto crits against tiny or smaller creatures
3. encounter a very angry goose. just the one. it is very angry. it will almost certainly attack the party
use this statblock? https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/da1nm6/the_goose_from_untitled_goose_game_monster/ 
   - after fighting it and continuing on, the party will encounter the corpse of a medium to large size monster that has been apparently killed by being pecked repeatedly
     - a manticore


12. A white rabbit wearing a waistcoat runs past into a cave, the party follows and visits wonderland?
13. do the dolphin rock bit?
    - the party comes across a rock in the shape of a dolphin. there’s nothing else special about it
14. strange weather: it literally starts raining cats/dogs/fish/men



misc ideas:
use the costume ball happening in a few days in town as a way to break the ice any introduce a few people from the monster town?
