# Future planning

- The exiled queen from Baggi's backstory sends warriors to assassinate Baggi/get him killed while out adventuring.
  - Similar-ish ploy by Thalok against Loroghan?
- want the social problems of the town to become a bigger thing
  - the miners stumble upon something underground, party sent to investigate?
  - Miners start getting killed, no one really seems to care much, party overhears the foreman begging Jemar to do something, he gives a non-answer
- Do something with Fragile riddle's request for a piece of vidrite
  - Could find some underground? find an intelligent monster that managed to prize off a shard?



### things mentioned that should come up later
- party comissioned a saddle and oil painting for Trip
  - Daerlin was making that painting, if the party makes them lose the election that might be awkward
- They got invited to a soiree when first visiting the posh bar, would occur about a week after
