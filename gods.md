- God-king that's just three halflings in a trench coat
  - In-universe an all-halfling memey party worked their way up to level 20 and got themselves installed as a single deity. Originally a party of 4 but the fourth died fighting the BBEG. 
  - The god-king's priesthood teaches he is made of 3 aspects: virtue, compassion and strength. He once had a 4th aspect, mortality, but that was shed in his final triumph over his adversary and ascension to godhood. 
  - In reality the original 3 adventurers eventually died and their descendants have taken over the role, swapping people out over the ages as people die. At any point the 3 halflings that form the god are level 20+ magic users, whenever one dies they hand their power down to their successor so every iteration of the god-king is equally as powerful. The upper echelon of the priesthood is just the extended family and friends of the original 3, all of whom would never betray the secret because they all find it an amazing joke.
  - The god-king is clad in shining crystal armor, only a select worthy few are allowed to see their true face underneath. Underneath the armor is the original ratty trenchcoat the founding 3 halflings wore, and beneath that is the current three halflings of course.
  - the fourth halfling or the original party, the one who died, didn't have a family, so they never had any descendants that became part of the god king. The god king and their priesthood makes sure that the 4th is never forgotten however, as the kingdom and the God-King itself is named after that fourth. The whole God-King bit had been Kithcaryn's idea to begin with who found it extremely hilarious. Her idea had been that the 4 of them would rotate between each of the 3 positions in the halfling tower and 1 day off out of every 4, but after her death the survivors decided not to take days off in her honour.
  - The kingdom they rule is a haven for people of all species and creeds, in classic halfling hospitality. Worship of other gods is allowed if uncommon, as most worship the god-king. One of the oldest currently standing kingdoms, around 400 years old. Located in an area of plains, prairies and forests all abounding with life, by far the most bountiful land on the continent.
- Genghis Khan like figure who conquered his way to godhood, and is worshipped as the Father god, as he literally is the ancestor of millions of beings now from a variety of species (let's just handwave over the inability of different species to breed bit. By the time he was close enough to godhood that part just didn't matter as much`).

## The Church of Ebor
Generally speaking, one of the priesthoods most widely accepted and popular among all kingdoms/cities. Their core tenets speak of non-agression, avoiding violence, protecting the weak, and trying to resolve conflicts through discussion. Along with the priests of Akkum, God of Justice, the priests of Ebor are known best for acting as fair and even-handed arbiters and judges for civil matters. The Eborian and Akkumian clergy have close ties and teachings, often resulting in close friendships between members of each. Eborian priests tend to go on pilgrimages or wander to teach their gods gospel far more often than other priesthoods, who mainly stay put in temples or monasteries. Ebor has far more paladins than many other gods because of this.

There are a variety of different philosophies on how to go about implementing Ebor's message of peace.These philosophies, while radically different, do not cause the split into different sect. Most temples will contain priests of each major school of thought, with many moderates in between them. One philosophy is, broadly speaking, to avoid conflict altogether. This sect often preaches to trust authority, to maintain the satus quo, to acquiesce to others' needs, and not to question those above oneself. This line of thinking can lead to some members of this sect promoting authoritarianism, and condemning rebellion or vigilantism. More than one Eborian priest has been seen condemning peasants for not paying their lord's taxes in a year of famine.

Another school of thought is that peace should aim to resolve conflict properly, not avoid it. This school teaches discussion, empathy, compassion and communication. They tend to most commonly be arbiters and judges, building and advocating for complex systems to resolve conflicts. Other Eborians criticize this school for being too bueracratic, for promoting compromise in cases where one party is clearly in the wrong, and for the systems they create occasionally being flawed and exacerbating the conflict.

The last major branch is the school of thought that, ironically enough, peace must be enforced and maintained through violence when necessary. Deemed the most radical branch by other Eborians, this school teaches that some conflicts cannot and should not be resolved by discussion. Conflicts should be resolved by the most appropriate tool based on the situation, sometimes that is discussion and compromise, but sometimes it is fire and sword. Many Eborian paladins are from this school, and there are even a few mercenary companies led by paladins of this school, who only take on contracts they think are just and are in the intrests of preserving or making peace.
